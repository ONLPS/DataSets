0,Nischai  Vats,"In the run up to the General Elections, the result of the 5 states are a direct mandate for the ruling BJP, which post 2014, seemed quite invincible but the juggernaut has been halted in the Hindi heartland by the arch rival,  . In a Bi-polar contest between the BJP and Congress, this time it was more about the rural issues, anti-incumbency and local leadership rather than campaign, manifesto and polarization. The result has a clear message for the RSS cadre that people won’t buy the temple rhetoric in every election and its high time that the Sangh Parivar looks for the course correction in its policies. An infamous acronym, TINA (There is No Alternative) had come into existence since the beginning of the Modi wave in 2014, and since then, it has been widely propagated on the news channel debates, social media etc. to convey a perception that BJP and PM   are the last resort and the only option for the voters of the country. But, come this December, and Congress has overturned the results of the Hindi speaking states in its favor and the acronym has been transformed to RITA (Rahul is the Alternative).The story of Rahul Gandhi 2.0 dates back to December 2017, when the nation saw a different wavelength in the Gujarat election, where the slogan of ‘Vikas pagal ho gaya hai’ kept trending on Twitter and the entire agrarian livelihood stood behind the Congress party. In the end, it was the Gujarati Asmita and the urban voters of Ahmedabad and Surat, who managed to get BJP escape through the majority mark. Although, Gujarat, which was popularly known to be the Hindutva laboratory of the BJP, had high rural distress amongst the villagers and the factors of anti-incumbency, Jignesh Mevani and   contributed. Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were mere an extension of the rural dissent and the shift of lower, backward class votes from BJP to Congress. Clearly, the politics of Mandir and accusations on Nehru-Gandhi family has been rejected and PM Narendra Modi will have to present his report card at the completion of his term. The result also hints that the right-wing parties and groups will re-strategize their policies and the reason to get afraid here is, either BJP will return to its development narrative or they will push the right-wing agenda to a whole new level, polarizing and communalizing the voters and the ambience even more. UP CM  , the star campaigner of BJP, has mostly downscaled the image of the party and wherever he campaigned, new controversies erupted from Lord Hanuman being ‘Dalit’ to changing the name of Hyderabad to Bhagyanagar. Yogi campaigned at 24 places in Chhattisgarh and BJP lost 16 of them; same goes in Madhya Pradesh, where he rallied in 13 districts and the party lost 8 of them, whereas in Rajasthan, Yogi went to 26 places and BJP lost in 13. Certainly, BJP has received a dent in its core vote base and the backwards have shifted from its grasp as the events in the last 2 years have merely presented the party appeasing the SC/ST, spreading communal agenda, pitching up the Mandir rhetoric ahead of polls and loosening the hold on economy but be assured, that the   school of election management is still preparing for the final exam and PM Narendra Modi remains the top leader of India at present and frontrunner in the 2019 polls, although the Modi wave might now have been vaporized. Amidst the slogan of ‘Congress Mukt Bharat’ by the BJP president Amit Shah, the grand old party has now managed to score another one, ‘BJP-rahit Hindi heartland’ which is a big shift in the tone being set for the 2019 elections. Congress will be the fulcrum of the Opposition in 2019 and now, after winning in the 3 big states, it will act like a magnet for the regional parties to form a ‘Mahagathbandhan’ and lead from the front. The only issue is that a ragtag coalition will not work, as seen in Telangana where the Congress went into alliance with TDP, CPI, TJS which seemed strong but only paper as it lacked vision and mission In the end, while it may be a major setback for the BJP in the state assembly results, it is definitely not a victory for the Congress, it can be a relief for them as they have found their winning ways again. Given the amount of farmers anger and rural distress in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress managed to touch the mere majority number in Rajasthan and fell short-off 2 seats in MP. The curious case of Mandsaur should be mentioned, which became a hub for protest as 6 farmers were killed in police firing during their strikes and   was directly blamed for it but in the assembly election, the BJP has won the Mandsaur seat. It clearly shows lack of organizational capacity, lack of election machine and a clear political roadmap on the part of Congress party. As the Mahaul is changing, the ghost of nationalism, Hinduism, chaiwala, surgical strikes and demonetization will haunt PM Modi, while he gets out for the electioneering in the next and final round of 2019, where he will have to answer the questions and not vice-versa. On December 11, it has been made sure that Lok Sabha election is an open game and the partnership of PM Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are not invincible, it’s up to the non-BJP parties which will set the momentum ahead and time will tell whether Rahul Gandhi, after hurting the BJP in its own bastion, can become the king maker.

The anti-incumbency is high in Chattissgarh but the BJP is trying to retain the state as most of the opinion polls suggest, that the ruling dispensation will be able to form the government.

The last phase had 18 seats and they were conducted under heavy security cover, due to Maoists boycotting the election and threats to life, and IED blasts have triggered a law and order situation, for which the election commission was prepared well enough.

44,Shriya Bhasin,"The much-awaited Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2018 happened with great spring and the competition between the ruling party BJP and the opposition Congress began with a bang, also with a decision by the Election Commission (EC) of the two-phase polls for as many as 90 seats that happened today and the other to happen on November 20. While on one hand CM Raman Singh has stood up for the fourth time, on the other hand, there is Congress that has put in all of its efforts to gain a place and replace BJP’s 15 years of exile from power in the state. If we go by the opinion polls that happened previously, a prediction came in where it was said that BJP has strong chances of winning it again in the 90-seat assembly. It is being expected that the party will gather some more seats this time and might get 50 out of 90, while on the other hand, the opposition Congress party’s seats might reduce from 39 to 30 this time and this has been predicted by India TV-CNX survey. ALSO READ:   Another reason why BJP’s win is being expected in the state is because of the candidate, says the survey, that about 40.71 per cent of people were in favour of Raman Singh, 19.2 per cent for Congress leader Bupesh Baghel, former CM Ajit Jogi had about 8 per cent share while TS Singh Deo had about 9 per cent people backing him. Not just this, a share of about 23 per cent believed that none out of the above were capable for the post.   After the survey, it was predicted by the political pundits that the most favourite amongst the CM candidate will likely win the elections. Meanwhile, these were the candidates who are on the ground of elections this time. ALSO READ:    Raman Singh has always maintained his image and has always maintained a balance between the welfare of the tribal as well as the development of the state whose inception came 18 years ago. Chhattisgarh, after its split from Madhya Pradesh has seen only two CMs namely Ajit Jogi and Raman Singh out of the two the later has been pronounced as the only ‘declared’ CM in high favour. Congress decided to bring minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla opposite him in Rajnandgaon.   Bhupesh Baghel, the President of Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee is also counted amongst one of the most deserving candidate from the Congress as he has a share of about 38 per cent people wanting him to be in power as compared to his competition in the party itself, TS Singh Deo, who only has 18 per cent people in his support.   Not just the leader of the Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, the richest candidate during the 2013 assembly elections, TS Singh Deo has been holded back by the high command in the party to not to be made the face of the party because it might alienate the supporters.   The underdog of the race is being called the former CM, Ajit Jogi who has this time entered the race through his own party JCC that he has formed in alliance with  's BSP and CPI. Well, it is not sure whether he will win the show or not but it is definitely beings aid that he could grab enough seats which might create a problem in the formation of the government.   ALSO READ:  As per the early predictions, it is being said that Jogi will not form any government but still has a hope to play the role of a kingmaker, just like Kumaraswamy and might enter the state as the CM by entering into an alliance with a political party that has huge numbers than that of JCC-BSP-CPI.

Several seers including Chief Priest of Ram Janambhumi Swami Satendra Das want this ban imposed everywhere since the entire district's name has been changed. Further, the seers have demanded this since they believe that the sale of meat and liquor in the entire newly name district will be an insult to Lord Ram because it is not just one part that is now recognised as Ayodhya. State government spokesperson and cabinet minister Srikant Sharma said on Sunday, “The government will ban sale of liquor and meat within the legal framework.” The State Government is well aware of the demands of the seers in Ayodhya, Sharma retorted. Besides, a VHP spokesperson called the intended move a welcome step. He said that the selling of liquor and meat has been hurting the sentiments of sainst in this religious town. Speaking to ANI, Acharya Satyendra Das said that Ayodhya is a sacred place and meat and liquor was never sold in the city, adding that the proposed ban will lead to a healthier lifestyle. This ban has been proposed due to the recent decisions taken by Chief Minister  , who currently is “revamping” Uttar Pradesh by renaming the cities of the state, that were inspired by the Mughal regime. Before changing Faizabad district's name as Ayodhya, UP Govt. Renamed Allahabad as Prayagraj. Also, it changed the name of Mughal Sarai station after Pandit Deen Dayal.

On Saturday, Ajendra Ajay, who is a member of Uttarakhand BJP’s media relations team, wrote to Central Board of Film Certification Chairman Prasoon Joshi, alleging that even though the Abhishek Kapoor-directed movie was based on one of the worst human tragedies, it made fun of Hindu sentiments. The BJP leader also objected to a kissing scene between the film’s two protagonists - played by Singh and Khan - in the film’s teaser as well as the tagline of the movie’s poster which says “Love is a pilgrimage.” Ajay claimed that the movie was an attack on the Hindu religion because Kedarnath shrine was a symbol of the faith of crores of Hindus. Speaking to PTI, Ajay said, ""By setting a romantic love story against the backdrop of a huge tragedy that occurred at Kedarnath, a centre of faith for crores of Hindus, the filmmakers have shown great disrespect to the followers of the religion.” The BJP leader also took exception to the film showcasing the love story between a Muslim porter and a Hindi pilgrim, questioning why the filmmakers couldn’t find a Hindu character for the lead.

It is they who are creating confusion regarding seat-sharing among the Bihar NDA constituents.” Now, the churning of votes and seats will keep happening until the election is around the corner, although the voting trends happen on caste basis and Ram Vilas Paswan and Upendra Kushwaha will play as the trump card for the BJP in consolidating the votes.

56,Shriya Bhasin,"The strategy of mixing politics with religion generally comes at the expense of secularism, tolerance and vulnerable minorities and ths riptide is generally the agenda of our dear Prime Minister, Mr.   and his Bhartiya Janata Party.  It seems as if Hindutva is the card for the ruling party and embracing it by glorifying the religion, the cow, banning of beef, putting a stop to cow slaughtering is their major concern while poor economic growth, decline in the number of jobs, fluctuating market, soaring rise in the fuel price etc is something which goes side by side.  But the question here arises- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER COMMUNITIES? Here is an open letter from an Indian who happens to be a Muslim and wants the Prime Minister to know how his politics of religion affects him and his life. ALSO READ:  “Dear Mr Prime Minister, Namaste, Aadaab! The wise should work without attachment (Nishkaam Karma), for the welfare of the society - The Bhagavad Gita As we start another year on a cautiously positive note for our loved ones and our great country, I thought of sharing some assorted thoughts with you. These somewhat seemingly disparate notions are linked by a deep love for the civilisation called India and a belief that constructive criticism is an example of tough love and not self-loathing. It is this love that motivates us to make things better, by identifying the flaws rather than sweeping them under the carpet. I belong to Lucknow (am originally from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, but have lived most of my life in Lucknow), the epitome of the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb. My first window to the outside world was the newspaper, perhaps justifiably delivered by a Panditji (read the Hindu learned man). Our house lay behind a building owned by a Jain family. The first sounds that broke the silence of the early morning hours were the azaan from nearby mosques, followed by bhajans, played out at a police post across the street. My father's best friend was Mr AN Singh. No Eid was complete without Singh uncle's visit. He even managed one such trip during a curfew relaxation, as the Ayodhya dispute engulfed north India. At Diwali, our refrigerator struggled to accommodate the boxes of sweets gifted to my father. The Holi procession passed through our street, and as boisterous children, we enjoyed the colourful sight with elders who had no qualms about getting a tilak from celebrants. At school, we took equal pride in reading about the exploits of Rani Laxmi Bai and Havildar Abdul Hameed. My parents had no issue with the singing of Vande Mataram during assemblies. Bhasha Bhaskar, my Hindi textbook, introduced me to the fascinating world of Hindu mythology. Each episode of the Hindu epics - Ramayana, and later Mahabharata - that was shown by our state broadcaster Doordarshan, was eagerly awaited by my family. I saw them as part of our shared heritage as Indians. But sir, something changed in 2014. I was made aware of my Muslim identity more than ever, though there is nothing in my attire and attitude that sets me apart. Religion to me has always been a private affair. Sadly, it seems that even secular voices like mine are fast becoming an object of ridicule in the name of chauvinistic nationalism (which I see as opposed to enlightened patriotism). I know what it is like to be a minority but this surcharged environment is an acutely distressing experience for me. Mr Prime Minister, you represent the whole of India, even the 69 per cent who did not vote for your party. As a tax-paying, law-abiding citizen of India, I have every right to question governance when I feel disconcerted or threatened. Isn’t it something that the Constitution guarantees me? As the past has shown, even the Grand Old Party of India was shown the door when it became complacent. Your remedy against corruption resonated with those who voted for you. It was a decisive mandate to turn things around. Unfortunately, many of your party workers took this as an opportunity to avenge the Muslim appeasement that happened under previous governments. Since then a counter-narrative has been created, with a measure of success, in order to bring Hindus under one umbrella. This “Us versus Them” psychosis will only make matters worse. As world events have shown, dividing people into specific groups inevitably leads to divided lands. Hate crimes are on the rise in our country. According to IndiaSpend, India's first data journalism initiative, 11 deaths resulting from cow-related hate crimes have been reported in 2017. This is the highest since 2010 and the minorities have been at the receiving end mostly. An Indian killing another Indian, driven by an extreme view of his faith, should be a cause of worry for us all. Since the 2019 general elections are not far away, it is time for you to take a clear and unequivocal stand. Good governance (or a certain interpretation of the term) is not for a privileged few as it seems to be becoming. In our national interest - please do not let the fringe become the new norm. I leave you with this quote from Mahatma Gandhi: “The conception of my patriotism is nothing if it is not always, in every case without exception, consistent with the broadest good of humanity at large. Not only that, but my religion and my patriotism derived from my religion embrace all life.” Sincerely, Inam Abidi Amrohvi” (The views in the letter, expressed by the writer are personal.)",2018-10-27 15:22:00+05:30,"Narendra Modi,Modi government,Indian economy,Politics of religion,Muslim Vote Bank,Muslims in Modi government,Lok Sabha elections,Lok Sabha elections 2019,Rupee vs Dollar,#whereisthechange"," Mr. Narendra Modi, here’s an open letter to you and your government asking you to stop this politics of religion | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

64,Shriya Bhasin,"In the honour of  independent India’s first deputy prime minister, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, our respected Prime Minister, Mr.  , inaugrated the the world’s tallest statue of the ‘Iron Man’ on his 143rd birth anniversary that happened to be on October 31, 2018. The rocky statue built in the middle of the waters of the Narmada river in Modi’s home state of Gujarat stands 182 metres (597 feet) tall and is made on the budget of approximately Rs 3000 crore. The inaugration that happened just a few months before the very important general elections next year made every Modi Bhakth proud but was it really necessary? Is this the real development that our country is need of? We think that the money just got wasted in a rocky statue that garnered a lot of protests headed out by environmentalists, affected villagers, non-government organizations and politicians of the opposition. ALSO READ:  If we look at the amount that has been spend on the statue ie Rs 2,989 crore, it is double the amount that was to be used in the Pradhanmantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (Prime Ministers Agriculture-Irrigation Scheme). It is so huge that the money, if was used effectively could have been used to build 2 new Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) campuses, 5 Indian Institute of Management (IIM) campuses, 6 Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) missions to Mars and further if we talk about, it could  irrigate 40,192 hectares of land, cover repair, construction of 425 small check-dams and many such important things.  If we go by a report of NDTV, around 75,000 tribals across 72 villages in Gujarat’s Narmada district have been badly affected by the contruction of the statue that had around 3,000 laborers and 300 engineers sweating badly and slaving on it. The  Sardar Sugar Mill in Sankheda because of the financial mismanagement of the board members got shut down leaving behind more than 1,500 farmers waiting for their dues amounting  Rs 12 crore to be paid. Ghanshyam Shah, a political expert based in Gujarat, during an interview that he gave to Mint said, “At a time when Gujarat is facing a water crisis due to lower availability in the Narmada dam, I think the statue project could have been postponed by a year.” Also, if a report by BBC is to be believed a Gujarat farmer, Vijendra Tadvi, said, ""Instead of spending money on a giant statue, the government should have used it for farmers in the district."" ALSO READ:  The controversial 182-meter concrete-steel-bronze acrolith isn’t impressing the opposition much. Senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said, “The Sardar was a true friend of laborers, farmers, Dalits and other economically weak classes with a liberal-democratic ideology but Modi and his party are out to make political capital out of his name without following the Iron Man’s thoughts.” It also came to light in a report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India that claimed that as many as five government-owned oil companies were asked to spend as many as Rs 1.5 billion as a part of their CSR (corporate social responsibility) activity. Well, after all this it seems as if everything is fair in love, war and politics especially when the elections are round the corner.

The building made on the budget of approximately Rs 2,989 crore represents the symbolic unification of India after its Independence. The statue has now become the world’s tallest one with the height of 182 metres (597 feet) but the question hear arises was it necessary? How would Sardar Patel would have reacted on the same. Here’s an open letter from one of the famous social activists of our country, Medha Patkar that will definitely open your eyes.   Respected Sardar Patelji, Namaskar! Wherever you may be, as our leader of the Freedom Movement, your soul, I know, rests here on the motherland whose beloved son you have always been. Your act of freeing India from the shackles of royal states and estates and of freeing the farmers from the oppressive tax laws of the British regime is unprecedented even to this day. As the first home minister of the first government of Independent India, your firm, non-communal and social approach to the unparalleled violence and the relief work thereafter, was appreciated by none else than Mahatmaji as unique, despite the controversy created by some. ALSO READ:  You stood tall in the historical freedom struggle of India as Sardar. But you know, while throwing your legacy by the way side, a 182 meter-high statue of yours is being unveiled in a few days to be the tallest in the world! Can you imagine who has built your new avatar? Many Chinese and some local Adivasi and national labourers have worked overnight on the ‘Sadhu Bet’, a hillock with Adivasi deity of their faith. You would surely ask, on whose land would this statue stand? Whose plan was this? This land, river, forest that your avatar is going to stand on, belongs to Adivasis. The very same people your government and then leaders, Mahatma to Pandit Nehru recognised as villagers with rights, as republics and offered security through Panchsheel. The forefathers of the Indian Constitution, with Babasaheb at the helm, also granted them right to peace and good government, through the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and later, the PESA Act towards self-reliance. You would surely watch from the highland, the scene down into the River Narmada and its banks to the basin wide and far. Your vision will find their huts and hamlets in the hills and hillocks one of which was Varata Bawa Tekri under your feet. Do remember the days when you carried out the operation to integrate the princely states with delicacy and democracy, to make most of them sacrifice voluntarily for unity. By the way, your avatar is also claimed to be for the same goal, unity…yet with the insanity of impinging upon not just their land but also their rights. Would you ever think of using ‘force’ against these simple and least monetised, self-reliant people, as had to be done against the princely state of Junagadh then? Sardar, these Adivasis also belong to the farming community you recognised as the contributors who feed and need to lead. Today, if only you know the reasons behind their laying life and cuddling death, you would have taken to the same task and struggle, combing villages and fields as in August 1942. But the most shocking for you, who acquired royal properties, dealt with transfers, created ‘privy purses,’ would be to know the ways and means of transferring today the life supporting resources of the very brethren you fought for, receiving acclaim for the social movement you built. Non-cooperation was the non-violent tool you exercised, under the guidance of Bapu then. ALSO READ:  The same tool is now a weapon in the hands of the Indian rulers, practising neo-colonial ideals. They do not bring in the horses or the Sepoys or take over properties of the rich and the mighty. They take over the very life line: land, water, river, forest and fish of the weak and the marginalised. Could you ever dream of the Indian State – the ICS cadres who you were treated as the ‘Patron Saint’ of, and the cabinet members, you warned against ‘partiality and corruptibility’ and incited against a path of rectitude in your speech on April 21, 1947 – assuming itself to be powerful enough to not only tax farmers but also exploit them through low prices for the produce and extract GST from small traders and evict the market infrastructure of the poor, the hawkers, in the name of huge, gigantic infrastructure? Is your legacy at stake, Sardar? How could they tolerate suicides by lakhs of farmers? ALSO READ:  Do please have a look on your left and you will find the six-lane highway running up to 120 km in length parallel to Narmada. Lakhs of trees, more than 100-years-old, within the last year had to make way for this highway. People of Rajpipla, once a princely state that is recorded in history for having defeated Aurangzeb’s forces are compelled to be mute spectators, having no channel to vent their Mann ki Baat. You, Sardar, once the chairman of the committees responsible for minorities, tribals, excluded areas and fundamental rights must also know that when your avatar will be well lit and decorated, the tribal communities, being repressed and oppressed, are to be thrown into darkness. Their lands, in six villages not even legally acquired, following British law of 1894, but simply taken over, paying a paltry sum of Rs 80 to Rs 200 per acre in 1961, are now being diverted for luxurious hotels named after ‘Shreshtha Bharath’ or Swaminarayan Complex and even a museum with their own remnants. You, who were successful in recovering the farmlands for the farmers refusing to pay the oppressive tax would come down to support these tribals who are not granted anything as per the new law of 2013, nor are gifted with alternative land but are being made to accept a Rs 7 lakh package which they too are non-cooperating with. You were at the forefront of such a struggle and having threatened to leave Congress, had made your party accept the path of non-violent yet militant battle that led you into jail in 1940 and a solid mass protest in 1942, with shutdown of none less than civil services! With your ability to organise the countrymen as also to face the onslaught of the imperialist forces, you could certainly challenge the present powers, the creators of your avatar, vouching for unity, but practising divide and rule tactics and promoting or allowing brutality, while denying diversity of creed, culture and religion. If only you would take a step forward and downward into the valley of Narmada, you would surely be overwhelmed with the simplicity of these nature-based generations-old communities, of Adivasis, farmers and fishworkers. Many of them had already lost their lands as it was acquired by the state for the Dam, again in your name, Sardar Sarovar, without paying them compensation worth a rupee. They too walked in your steps, faced attacks, and were sent to jails. (Jail? You had called it a ‘place for peace’, in 1943, remember?) The government in 2013 issued orders and made promises to give land for land. But ultimately they are being cheated and evicted out of their balance land for tourism! Do please have an eye on these fast track operations around, as only you can stop them from further damage…only you can! Sardar, the scale and impact of forcible encroachment upon the lives of the communities in this most ancient Narmada civilisation and the valley, can be seen by someone of your stature and perspective. No one can hold your hand today, but you could and would drag the sena/army of bureaucrats out of their villages with your ‘iron hand’ if only you witnessed their might against the toilers’ rights. Will you, our beloved leader, engage the powers that be in a thorough review and reflection? Gone are the days when yourself and Gandhiji had such a discourse on the floor of the jail and evolved a vision of swaraj and self-reliance, of agriculture and village republics. Gone are the days when you valued production by masses to ensure equity in both the economy and the social life. I feel ashamed to tell you that there was no need to bring in 1,500 Chinese workers here while excluding local adivasis from Gujarat, your own state, many of whom are compelled to migrate and harvest sugarcane, working day and night. I feel shaken to share with you what is being planned and publicised in your name… Shopping malls, five or seven star hotels, luxurious guest houses, helipads, statewise bhavans on the river bank with all its paraphernalia the shops, markets, massive food plaza, food courts, walk ways, travelators and what not. All this when not less than 35,000 families, affected by the Dam in your name since years, are still awaiting full, fair and just rehabilitation.  They never marketised Narmada, nor its water. They are damned by the Dam but are most awed and anguished to see their sacrifice being taken as a capital for the tourism industry and as everyone knows, political tourism too. They are sad that the farmers of Gujarat, the progeny of your movements are left high and dry… while the corporates reap huge benefits. Your contribution to the farmers and vision of India are enshrined with that of Mahatmaji and Nehru in all our memories. You accepted Panditji, and vowed for unity within Congress. The common citizens of this country have no place in this gigantic play today, Sardar. All lights will be on you, the avatar, Sardar, while throwing everything that you practised and preached is intentionally left to the dark recesses of history books and the future of the Adivasis and this country is being sealed with the new paradigm. Your generation was aware of two vices – corruption and communalism. The spirit behind your then sermons is needed today. Your NO to communalism reflected in your appeal to the religious leaders during communal violence following the partition that was inevitable. Your speeches across India and a letter to Golwalkar Guruji against the Hindu fundamentalist vision of RSS asking them to change and get integrated, is to be read and imbibed by every citizen of the country today. Those who are hiding behind your new Avatar, and marketing you, have never engaged themselves to understand your thoughts and your action to over come violence, to move from monarchies to democracy, from monopoly and hegemony to equity and fraternity. They do not visit the families of those lynched by mobs. They do not respect the resolutions of the adivasis.

Another leader who belonged to Congress party said that Ambedkar wants to part ways with Congress party and hence, the condition of 12 seats came up. Ambedkar, had earlier said that he was willing to join the Congress alliance but will have nothing to do with the Nationalist Congress Party.

83,Speed News Desk,"Alarm bells are ringing for the magnificent Great Indian Bustard (GIB) which is   seemingly at the end of its tether. Things are bad with its habitats in Rajasthan and in the states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra and Karnataka where too it is spotted in ones and twos. It t may not be any exaggeration to say that the species is going to be as dead as the Dodo in a few years. Those who are familiar with contemporary natural history of Rajasthan would remember that the species was saved from annihilation in the late seventies  from the hands of Arab Sheiks by valiant environmental crusaders with the support of Rajasthan Patrika. Rajasthan accounts for majority of the GIB population, locally known as Godawan, where the species enjoys the status of the State Bird. However the climb down of  its population has been so steep in the past one decade that the bird watchers now would think themselves  lucky to spot one even in the Desert National Park (DNP) in western Rajasthan. While even optimistic estimates put their number at less than 200, the official figures are alarmingly low, at 150. Even this is challenged by the conservationists in Rajasthan who have been visiting GIB habitats year after year.  “The past one decade had been particularly bad for the Great Indian Bustards. The DNP project never took off despite many starts,” notes Rajpal Singh Tanwar, conservationist and member of the Rajasthan Wildlife Board. “We can say that their population is all time low now,” he observes. “I would put their number at less than 140 in Rajasthan. The rest of the states either have no breeding populations or any population worth mentioning. If we want to see the species alive we have to concentrate on its major population in the Thar region (western Rajasthan),” he points out. In fact Mr. Tanwar has been lucky spotting the GIB (Ardeotis nigriceps) and clicking pictures (see photo) during a recent visit to DNP. A recent survey by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India(WII) found their total  number   to be 150 birds with Rajasthan accounting for as many as  128. The GIB numbers totaled to 22 in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra. The available data indicates that back in the 1970s their count was between 1200 and 1500. By 2011 the numbers plummeted to 250. Thereafter, in 2013 GIB was listed among the critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Even Rajasthan’s Chief Wildlife Warden, GV Reddy has gone on record to say that “if not saved now, GIB will become extinct within a decade”.  The bird has only a scanty presence in Maharashtra and Gujarat. The IUCN report that time had pointed out the damage to the Bustard habitats in Maharashtra and Kutch. The habitat of the bird has been encroached upon in these places and many birds succumbed to the human interference which also brought about destruction to the grasslands. The power lines, the predatory dogs and poaching did away the birds which are the heaviest of the flying birds. “Even in Rajasthan the areas they are spotted have come down. Monsoon is the time they breed. This monsoon many were not seen. Places like Sorsen in Baran district and Sudhashree in DNP, indentified with Bustards in the past, the birds were not visible anymore,” notes Mr.Tanwar. The most celebrated of the three of the bustard species found in India-- besides Lesser Florican and Bengal Florican—GIB’s plight should alarm conservationists and conservation planners alike. Otherwise, they would soon be confined to the pages of history. ends",2018-10-16 20:50:00+05:30,,  Great Indian Bustard on the Dodo way? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

He had also given up membership of the Upper House at the time of resignation as he was an elected Member of Legislative Council.

Congress has been looking for a tough ground to work upon in Jammu but the Kashmiri Pandits have majorly supported the Hindutva forces, belittling the work of the grand old party. To accommodate leaders and maintain stability and peace in the region, Congress had to make electoral alliances with the regional parties like National Conference, which has weakened the base of the party in the state. Highly placed sources said for the last couple of months, the Congress leadership was in touch with Vikramaditya, who had quitted the PDP on October 22, 2017, blaming the then  -led PDP-BJP government for propagating the “anti-Jammu policies”.

136,Joyjeet Das,"There was a strange sense of deja vu when an impessive cast of social activists gathered at the Press Club of India Thursday. They were there to register their protest against the way the Maharashtra Police has gone after their fellow activists across the country, labelling them nothing short of terrorists. Among others in the crosshairs of the Pune Police is labour rights activist Sudha Bharadwaj. Some two-and-a-half months ago, when the same police picked up and whisked away Sudhir Dhavale, Surendra Gadling, Shoma Sen, Rona Wilson and Mahesh Raut (June 6), Bharadwaj joined forces with legal activists – she herself is an advocate and is the vice-president of Indian Association of People's Lawyers – to condemn the crackdown. In that  , Bharadwaj, Supreme Court advocate Nithya Ramachandran, Progressive Women's Association's advocate Poonam and others raised serious question marks on the intent of the police force and the   (BJP) – in power in Maharashtra as well as at the Centre – on whose order it was acting. All the same there was a sense of surprise among the speakers at the way the estalishment had gone after those they believed were workign only for common good.Thursday's gathering showed that surprise has given way to anger. Speaker after speaker blew holes in the 'Urban Naxal' narrative – holes that the Modi government, the BJP and its ideological fountainhead, the  , will find hard to plug. They included: After Dhawan, whose PUDR colleague Gautam Navlakha is on the Pune Police's list, flagged off the session Roy took over, alleging that the drive against Bharadwaj, Navlakha and activists Varavara Rao, Arun Ferreira and Vernon Gonsalves was basically a crackdown on dissent – an effort to drive fear. Drawing links between the polic action and next year's general elections, she said “lies are being spread” using a section of the media.  “What is the evidence (against the accsued) the police have?” asked the seasoned activist who helped the erstwhile   government with public policy. Highlighting the work done by Bharadwaj, Navlakha and others for the marginalised, she asked “can no one speak for Dalits and the poor?” Parikh likened the current situation with the Emergency imposed by former PM Indira Gandhi and charged the current regime with similar misuse of power. His PUCL colleague Pancholi agreed. “We should take lessons,” he said and recounted how the people had backed civil liberites over relative prosperity in the '70s.  He also condemned the coinage of terms like 'Urban Naxals' and its use by the establishment – a sentiment shared by Menon-Sen. “Strange animals are being created. On the one hand we have the peacock that doesn't lay eggs but reproduce by consuming tears; on the other hand we have the Urban Naxal,” she said. “What is their crime? Upholding and propagating the Constitution and constitutional values?” she asked. The gender activist warned the “ones in power” that their efforts would backfire. “We see through their games,” she said. Wilson, who has long worked for the upliftment of manual scavengers underscored an anti-Dalit line in the government's thinking and working. Calling the crackdowns an “attack on fundamental rights”, he alleged that an atmosphere of fear was being created where one wasn't free to act. The State was against Dalit assertion, he said. “We have beenn enslaved for 5,000 years. What's wrong with celebrating Bhima-Koregaon?” he asked and pointed out how activist-poet Rao's daughter was questioned by the police on her choice of marrying a Dalit and not marking herself with vermillion. On the other hand, there were no arrests of those who burn copies of the Constitution, he said. Mevani, who has gained quite a following in the recent years, said there was a combination of three things: an undeclared Emergency, fascism and the 'Gujarat model'. He said those against the “Sangh” were being terrorised and Dalit assertion was being discredited. He cited the examples of atrocities in Una (Gujarat) and Shahranpur (Uttar Pradesh), the imprisonment of Dalit activist Chandrasekhar and prohibitory orders against him in districts of Rajasthan as examples of how the regime was against “andolankaris”. Mevani, who was present at the Elgar Parishad meeting before the Bhima-Koregaon episode, ridiclued the police claim of a plot to assasinate PM Modi. “This used to happen in Gujarat: every year some or the other jihadi supposedly came to kill him and died in encounters,” he said. Alleging that the police of Delhi and Maharashtra were acting in collusion, he pointe dout that central minister Ramdas Athavale has already ruled out any Maoist links of those who were at the Bhima-Koregaon Dalit celebration. Mevani announced wider agitations on 5 and 15 September. “What is happening in the country now? Attacks on Adivasis, Dalits and Minorities; lynch mobs are being unleashed,” said Bhushan, addign that the likes of 'Sambhaji' Bhide and Milind Ekbote were walking free. Focusing on symantics, he said Urban Naxals was a coinage similar to the 'Tukdetukde Gang' that was used against student activists leading up to a physical attack on Kanhaiya Kumar and a recent attempt to kill Umar Khalid. “Even the police used the term (Urban Naxals) in court. Me, Aruna, Arundhati... we are called Urban naxals,” he said. Bhushan pointed out that those against whom the police were acting were not even present in Bhima-Koregaon. “Democracy is not killed by military coups. The fascists eliminate human rights gradually, so not many understand what's happening, unlike during the Emergency that happened in one stroke. Everythign is now at stake,” Bhushan said. Man-Booker winner Roy pointed out that there was already an acceptance by the police that the activists were “anti-fascists” as they said in the Pune court. She said “the government knew there would be a reaction” and drew attention to the recent drop in Modi's popularity ratings according to a recent ABP Lokniti survey. Touching upon various issues, including the Rafale deal, she said what was going on was a “coup against the Constitution.

137,Speed News Desk,"In normal times Britain’s former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson’s observation that burqa clad women resemble walking “letter boxes” and “bank robbers” would evoke laughter. But these are not normal times. Just when liberals were beginning to pelt stones at him, a startling turn to the debate was given by Taj Hargay, Imam of Oxford. “The burqa is a Wahabi fifth column…we will wake up in the Islamic Republic of Britain.”Johnson’s observation is mischievous, and has a political purpose, the Imam’s an exaggeration. The observations are troubling for an Indian Muslim. I would avoid being judgemental on a community which has been under immense pressure because of rampaging Islamophobia since the 90s. And yet, I cannot help asking: is the burqa a response to nasty Islamophobia or a means of aggravating it? Aggravation of the problem is surely not our purpose. Then whose purpose is served by Muslim women floating around Oxford Circus in gear which distances them, in geometrical progression, from the host population? Of the clerics, eager to consolidate their congregations? Wouldn’t it be wonderful if these congregations had in their midst scholars, doctors, writers, scientists, entrepreneurs, rather than pliant women fitting Boris Johnson’s description. I am troubled for another reason. After extensive travel around the world, I am inclined to cast my vote in recent years for Britain as a society where Human Rights, Rule of Law, Race relations are most secure. That is why I am uneasy at the two observations. Let me turn to India to bring out my point, by comparison, in bolder relief. The depths to which Hindu-Muslim relations have sunk in India is attributed by pundits to the brazenly communal politics of the ruling BJP under Prime Minister,   since 2014. If an ancient civilization, embracing 1.25 billion people can be so totally transformed in merely four years, Modi and his cohorts deserve to be celebrated as miracle men. No, the present government has clearly accelerated the communal agenda but the ground for it was diligently laid over 71 years of independence. The ruling party for most of these decades was the Congress. Social disharmony was built into the manner in which Partition was affected. The Congress was firmly opposed to the two-nation theory enunciated by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan – that Hindus and Muslims constituted two separate nations. But the Congress accepted Lord Mountbatten’s June 3, 1947 plan for Partition in double quick time. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, former President of the Congress and others warned Pandit Nehru that Partition would mean “unadulterated Hindu Raj”. By that logic once the Congress Working Committee had accepted a Muslim state, with a small Hindu minority, named Pakistan, it logically followed that the rest of India would be Hindustan or a Hindu state with a substantial Muslim minority. In other words, on August 15, 1947 India glided seamlessly from British Raj to Hindu Raj but Nehru chose not to use the term “Hindu” for a variety of reasons. A “Hindu” state was an affront to his self image. Self image was important to Nehru. The basic reason why Nehru avoided the term “Hindu” to describe the new found state was Kashmir. How could a Hindu state claim the Muslim majority province of Kashmir on the principle of contiguity? Look at it from the hard core Hindu perspective. After a thousand years of Muslim rule, 200 of British, the Muslim state of Pakistan does come into being. But, alas no Hindu state. The sophistry of why it is so is lost on the millions. This is where the Hindu communalist pitches his tent. It turns out that, over the decades, a compulsive hatred for Pakistan has emerged an acid test for nationalism. Into this bubbling cauldron has been pushed a boulder – the post 9/11 war against terror. The Islamophobia this has generated globally has been grist to the Hindu communalist’s mill too. I have argued in my book “Being The Other: The Muslim in India” that calling a spade a spade at the very outset would have minimized the social disharmony that has plagued us for 71 years. From day one we should have declared ourselves a Hindu state. The Hindu in this “raj” would have been at the steering wheel but the minorities would have struck a stronger bargain for education, seats in Parliament, jobs in the cabinet, Civil Service, Police, Armed Forces and so on. Detractors raise a howl of protest. How can a theoretic state be secular? In the recent elections in Pakistan three Hindus, Mahesh Malani, Hari Ram Kishwari Lal and Giyan Chand Essrani, won from general seats in Sind – one for the National Assembly and two for the Provincial Assembly. The fact that Britain is a Protestant monarchy did not come in the way of Sadiq Khan serving as London’s high profile Mayor. Last year Donald Trump banned travel to the US from several Muslim countries. He was therefore not accorded a “state” visit to Britain because in that event protocol would have involved the Mayor of London. In India’s circumstances in 1947, a Hindu India may have been better, than the one cloaked in a hollow and bogus secularism where the police watch on as one Muslim (or Dalit) after another is lynched, some to the accompaniment of expert photography.

Issuing a strict memo to party leaders, Gandhi assertively said that the lawyers from the party should avoid fighting for Anil Ambani on the Rafale issue on which the opposition parties are targeting the   government. Earlier, Ambani’s companies sent notices to Congress spokespersons over the issue and told Gandhi that he is ‘misinformed, misdirected and misled’ about the multi-billion dollar jet fighter deal. Gandhi questioned the government over the deal many times in public as well as in the parliament, pointing out that the governments stroke the deal with the price of three times higher than that negotiated by the UPA government with France’s Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of the aircraft. His party along with other politicians has been demanding to disclose the price of the aircraft. The party also demanded a joint parliamentary committee on the deal. Eyeing on the 2019 general elections, Gandhi asked the party leaders to avoid cases that becomes a tool of attack on the party from the government or that weaken the party stands.

142,Rajeev Khanna,"The recent developments on Punjab's political turf point towards one thing – Panthic issues will be at the core of the campaign for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls while real problems will be at the second or third rung. The grounds have been prepared for political battles on these issues that have taken the centre stage while the problem of drug menace, farmer suicides, unemployment, etc stand pushed back. Right now it is the findings of the Justice (retired) Ranjit Singh Commission on the instances of sacrilege of holy texts that has emerged as a major point of contention between the ruling   and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD). The commission report, leaked recently, reportedly indicts former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for being in the know of police action on protestors at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan in 2015 that led to the death of two persons. This has put the Akalis on the back foot.  But the party has launched a counter attack. Its President, Sukhbir Singh Badal, alleged a “sinister conspiracy to defame the erstwhile SAD-BJP ( ) government and divide the Sikh community.” He released call details to accuse Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, his ministers as well as Ranjit Singh of consorting with radical ‘sarkari’ jathedars to vet the Commisison report tabled in the state Assembly last Monday. “The unholy nexus between the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intlligence)-sponsored radical outfits to help the Congress wash its sins against the Sikhs is out in the open,” Sukhbir said. He also accused Amarinder of meeting Sikh radical Baljit Singh Daduwal secretly at his residence.  Taking strong exception to these allegations the CM called for a probe by the Speaker into the charge of his meeting Daduwal. On the other hand, Sikh harliners have been holding a 'Morcha' at Bargari for a couple of months now, seeking action against the police officers guilty of firing at the protestors and those responsible for sacrilege of holy texts. The issue of sacrilege is all set to dictate the political discourse in this sensitive border state ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Along with the Commission's findings has been the recent decision of the Punjab Cabinet for bringing in amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedures and the Indian Penal Code to make sacrilege of all religious texts punishable with life imprisonment for “curbing such incidents and maintaining communal harmony” in the state. According to an official spokesperson, the Cabinet approved insertion of Section 295AA to the Indian Penal Code (IPC) to provide that “whoever causes injury, damage or sacrilege to Sri Guru Granth Sahib, Srimad Bhagwad Geeta, Holy Quran and Holy Bible with the intention to hurt the religious feelings of the people, shall be punished with imprisonment for life.” While the move has been termed 'regressive' by many intellectuals, no political party has come forward to denounce it. This move too is all set to be played up during the poll campaign. Meanwhile, the dynamics within the main political forces are changing. With AAP continuing to function as a split force following the rebellion led by Sukhpal Singh Khaira and some of its legislators aligned with him, the party is is no position to reap political dividends in Parliamentary elections. The Congress remains smug with almost the entire support base of AAP, along with the Hindu voters, making a shift towards it during the recent bye-elections. Though it is facing criticism for failing to deliver on promises made ahead of last year's Assembly polls, curbing drug abuse problems, Controlling law-and-order and addressing unemployment, continuing anger among the public against the previous Akali-BJP regime is helping the Grand Old Party. The Akalis have meanwhile chosen to project as a party working for the aspirations of Sikhs, with Sukhbir reportedly trying to resurrect the party on those lines. This comes as a deviation of the party's 'Punjab, Punjabi and Punjabiyat' stand that it had been taking since its Moga anniversary in 1996. The Akalis are trying to project the Congress as anti-Sikh and the recent comments of the Congress president   on the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom at an interaction in London has given them enough fodder to rake up the issue once again to put the Congress on the back foot. The issue of '84 keeps returning ahead of elections despite the fact that the state has elected Congress governments in both Delhi and Punjab on multiple occasions since then. The Akalis face the counter charge of having failed to get the BJP, which is their ally at the Centre to get justice for the victims of '84 riots during the National Demcratic Alliance regimes led by Atal Behari Vajpayee and now  . The BJP that continues to throw in its lot with the Akalis remains on a sticky wicket. It remains on the defensive for the actions of its central leadership. Both demonetisation and shoddy implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have ensured its base of small Hindu traders making a departure. The Akalis projecting themselves as party of Sikhs too is expected to have its implementation. The party also lacks a face at the state level. It looks imminent that issues pertaining to religion will dominate the political discourse in the state in the months to come. The real issues will once again take a back seat.

148,Waquar Ahmed,"Goa has been thrown into political crisis as the state’s chief minister   has been ailing for the past some months. Parrikar, who was the Union Defence Minister before becoming the chief minister of the state, was sent back by the BJP top brass to Goa to form the government in the state despite gaining less seats than the Congress in the last assembly elections. Parrikar did it and formed the government taking support from other political parties – Goa Forward Party (GFP) and Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) - and Independent MLAs. Out of 40 MLAs, BJP has 13, GFP and MGP have 3 each and there are 3 Independents while the Congress has 16 MLAs. One of the primary reasons for which GFP, MGP and Independent MLAs supported the BJP to form the government was Parrikar himself. That’s why, he was sent back to the state to get the BJP government formed. Now, as 62-year-old Parrikar has been undergoing a prolonged treatment for a pancreatic ailment and is not able to discharge his constitutional duties; the threat to the existence of the BJP government is looming large. The allies of the BJP are not ready to accept any other BJP leader as the chief minister and also forcing the saffron party to come up with a permanent solution to the current impasse. At the another hand, the Congress which has 16 MLAs, needs 5 MLAs to gain simple majority, has already met the governor Maridula Sinha to stake a claim to form the government. However, after a meeting held between BJP’s central representatives with its allies in the Goa government, the party rejected to replace ailing Parrikar with any other leader as the chief minister. It is not clear yet that how long this impasse will continue to exist. There is a discontent in regard to prevailing political situation in the state among BJP leaders too. “The situation continues to be fragile in the state. Parrikar is indisposed and he may require prolonged hospitalisation. It’s not easy to find his replacement since allies aren’t amenable to accept anyone from within the party in the chief minister’s chair,” a senior BJP functionary was quoted by the New Indian Express as saying. The possible situation that may prevail on the political landscape of the state may be like Karnataka. The Congress had formed the government there by giving the chief ministership to the JD(S) despite the BJP was the largest party in Karnataka assembly elections. Here in Goa, the Congress may repeat its Karnataka strategy to form the government. If Congress’s Karnataka strategy works here successfully, the allies of the BJP may switch to the Congress and the BJP-led government will collapse.   Also read: ",2018-09-18 18:32:00+05:30,"Goa political crisis,Manohar Parrikar,goa government,Ailing Manohar Parrikar,Goa Chief Minister,Goa BJP,BJP-led Goa government", Goa political crisis: Is BJP-led government heading towards collapse? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

The arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, Gautam Navlakha, Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao and Arun Ferreira, in the Bhima Koregaon is a case that has all the elements of an attempt to use an FIR to target a particular kind of dissenting voice, and use undefined terms like “urban naxal” to divert from the main issue itself. This is not just baffling for the ordinary reader – but is a new kind of threat to the democratic practices in India. The attack on human rights workers is an attempt to silence the messenger. Given the very high credibility of the people concerned, an orchestrated campaign with the media has been used. News has itself become a strange brew of half-truths, rhetorical statements and deliberate mis-communication. In addition, the state and corporate interests exercise huge commercial control over the media, and many of the causes of tribal communities that are espoused by these activists are in direct conflict with the commercial interests of the media ownership. Users of “social media” advocate causes, make twisted statistical representations, and generate propaganda –all under the credibility that “media” enjoys in large part. The citizen is caught in a web of cross cutting information, where truth is elusive, and it is difficult to differentiate between fact and fiction. Let’s try and examine some of the facts of this FIR. The Elgar Parishad was an event organized by Dalits in celebration of an old tradition- a historic defeat of the Peshwas at the hands of the Mahars in the 1800s. Two ex judges, Justice Patil and Justice Sawant, former Supreme Court judge and former Chair of the Press Council, were part of the organizing team. On January 1, 2018, there was a clash between the Dalits and the upper castes. FIRs were lodged by the Dalits and a cross case later by the others. The accusations now added to the list, were not in the FIR and none of those arrested were present either at the Elgar Parishad, or on the of January 1. The first claim made by the Pune police was, that these were Maoists responsible for planning and fomenting the violence that took place on January 1. The claim that the arrested activists were a threat to the state and national security has been added subsequently. There is no doubt that rising inequalities in India are the leading marginalized communities – particularly Dalits and Tribals-- to organize to fight for survival and reclaiming citizenship. The citizen’s exercise of sovereignty, ie asking questions about land and natural resources, non-delivery of services, justice and dignity, especially for the most marginalized and discriminated, is branded as anti- national to escape scrutiny. Their advocates suffer the same fate and are hounded to prevent the amplification of the voices against corruption and injustice. The categorization of “anti-national” has now a twin in “urban naxal”. Vague and subjective and incomprehensible; and yet they are used to prosecute and silence people. The governments, normally riddled with corruption and arbitrary use of power, are afraid of disclosures, accountability and the rule of and by law. When they are confronted by public scrutiny into the exercise of unconstitutional power, they take refuge in accusations of terrorism, sedition etc. to suppress all questioning. The suffering communities and individuals are often the victims of the privileged elite. The RTI has legitimized questioning and the corrupt system is feeling threatened by it, as the attempts to amend and the killing of RTI users amply prove. Branding of opposition as “Maoists or terrorists”, and “urban naxalites” has enabled governments to build public acceptability, supporting arbitrary decisions made in camera. Rationality falls victim to the fear of government vendetta and silence prevails. The system protects its charges with dossiers and secret files created to indict activists. The use of the RTI has proven quite clearly that the sovereign citizen is often in ignorance of acts done in her/his name. Therefore any claim of “evidence” is suspect unless it is allowed public scrutiny. There are few tools besides the RTI to test sources of the evidence and the veracity of the testimonies. This attack on civil rights defenders is in some ways worse than the declaration of the Emergency in 1975, where the motivation was to cling to political power. This is not just about political power, but to change the ideas of justice and equity. Like then, civic space is being narrowed down and an atmosphere of fear is created. But today, people who have dedicated their lives to and speak for constitutional rights are branded as criminals and terrorists and there is a vicious attempt to destroy their credibility. An attack on the rights of civil society by gagging its spokespersons will destroy the idea of India. This idea was crafted carefully by the constituent assembly to give legitimate space for the peaceful and just co-existence of disparate cultures, ideologies and thought, to enable a steady, though difficult journey towards a more just and equitable India.   BY ARUNA ROY",2018-09-21 18:07:00+05:30,,   Attack on the conscience keepers; Attempt to silence the messenger    | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

Chowdhury was quoted by the Indian Express as saying “For us, our holy scripture, the Quran Sharif, is supreme and if any constitutional provision or any law contradicts the Quran, then our scripture will prevail and not the law or Constitution… BJP is playing the religion card and is playing with Constitution. The ordinance will have no effect on Muslims. No one will adhere to it, but will follow the religion and the holy book”.

Pointing to daily violence against women, the minister said “Every day, women and girls are being raped. Every day, women are being burnt and brutalised.

155,Speed News Desk,"Tigers are not yet out of the brink but their tribe is increasing steadily though slowly. India can take pride in the success of the efforts made in the past over the conservation of the tiger population and protection of their habitat as more than half of the wild tigers in the world are in Indian forests.One of the slogans given on the occasion of the creation of July 29 as the Tiger Day at the gathering of Tiger Range countries in St. Petersburg in Russia in 2010 was the doubling of the tiger population which, at that time, was on a steady decline. In another six years(2016), the bodies behind the Tiger Day such as World Wide Fund for Nature(WWF), IFAW (International Fund for Animal Welfare), and the Smithsonian Institute came out with the positive news that their numbers have increased. The agenda of the Tiger Day was to tackle the problems of large scale habitat loss and increasing animal-human conflicts. The shrinking of forests and increasing human activity which comes with the fast urbanization of the tiger countries were issues of grave concern. All these were compounded by the absence of a political will and a flourishing global trade in tiger parts. As for India, which launched its Project Tiger to conserve the population of tigers back in 1973 after its first tiger census in 1972, the news of multiplying tigers is all the more encouraging. The 2016 figures worldwide put the total number of the big cats at 3890, a big leap from 3200 tigers in 2010. “The revival has been slow but steady. The overall situation is encouraging thought still there are multifarious issues threatening the world tiger population,” observes Rajpal Singh, author and member of the Wildlife Advisory Committee, Rajasthan. “Each of the tiger country has its own specific problem. Take the case of Bangladesh, or even a more resourceful, Russia. The monitoring of tigers in the wild remains poor. One major reason is the vastness of the areas involved along with the paucity of resources,” Mr. Singh denotes. Talking about tigers in India’s wild, the conservationists are more enthusiastic even when they concede that the crisis is not yet over. India which has tiger population in its 17 states has almost doubled their numbers since the commencement of the Tiger Day. Tiger deaths are continuing to disturb both the tiger lovers and policy planners in India. As per the records of the Tigernet, collaboration among national Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) and the wildlife NGO, TRAFFIC, as many as 76 tigers were killed in the country during 2016. In the previous year the number of casualties was 69. Madhya Pradesh accounted for one third of the deaths while Karnataka, with the largest tiger population in the country, recorded 13 tiger deaths. A large number of deaths were due to direct or indirect human intervention. Poaching was found to be a major threat. “Tiger is not exactly burning bright the world over, though one cannot deny that they are doing reasonably well in India,” says Dharmendra Khandal, conservationist associated with the wildlife NGO, Tiger Watch. “We have reasons to celebrate in Rajasthan, especially in Ranthambhore. The tiger population in Ranthambhore has doubled. Their number is 67 now, highest in the history of the park,” notes Dr. Khandal. “Though I cannot say the same about Sariska tiger reserve which has had its own setbacks and still continues to falter,” Dr. Khandal observes.  ",2018-07-28 19:53:00+05:30,, The Day of the Tiger | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

157,Charu Kartikeya,"Prime Minister  ’s speech at the ground-breaking ceremony of various projects in Uttar Pradesh was at once a celebration of the crony capitalism he is often accused of and a denigration of every entity that resists it. Ever since Congress President   accused Modi of running a “suit-boot ki sarkaar” over three years ago, this is the first occasion when the PM himself has presented a vocal support of industry. He was not afraid of standing by the side of industralists, Modi said. This strange defence could not have come at a worse moment for him, at a time when his government is facing a relentless campaign unleashed by the Congress party over the multi-million dollar Rafael deal. The Congress has alleged that Modi-government agreed to inflated costs of fighter jets to benefit Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Defence. In spite of multiple rebuttals, BJP has not been able to conclusively dispel these charges. Gandhi and his party have kept up the heat on Modi with fresh charges related to the deal on almost a daily basis. Modi’s Lucknow speech was clearly a response to these allegations, but it is unlikley to have helped his case. Look at how he framed the discourse. In his defence of industry, he began with listing legal checks and balances, environmental concerns and media scrutiny as evils and as insurmountable challenges. Note the brazen underlying assumption – all private capital is noble while legal requirements, environment compliances and media coverage are obstacles. The country is run either by the Prime Minister or by the patwari, Modi went on to say, clearly showing his own inability to look beyond himself. The structure of the state – comprising the legislature, executive (headed by the President acting on the advice of a Council of Ministers) and judiciary – does not matter to the Prime Minister. Neither do the people who elect their representatives to govern the country on their behalf or the Constitution that provides the foundation of the state. “We are not those who are afraid of standing by the side of industrialists, unlike those who are never photographed with any businessmen but all businessmen pay obeisance at their doorteps,” Modi stressed. “When the intention is clean, one can stand with anybody without attracting any stains,” he elaborated. In this context, he also chose to give the example of Mahatma Gandhi’s friendship with GD Birla. It is baffling to try to understand how can allegations of helping businessmen seen as close to the PM, and other leaders of the ruling party, with government largesse be equated with the relationship between the leader of India’s freedom movement and an ideologically committed businessman who supported the struggle. What exactly is Modi trying to argue by putting poor farmers, artisans, labourers, bankers-financers, bureaucrats and industrliasts in the same bracket? All businesses are not being maligned here. The scrunity is directed only at a select few against whom evidence of receiving undue favours from the government is piling up. Modi also said no action used to be taken against crony capitalists earlier because previous governments were involved in various dealings with them behind the scenes. “Don’t we know in whose planes do people travel,” was Modi’s apparent taunted at Opposition leaders. He appears to have conveniently forgotten how he himself, as Chief Minister of Gujarat and the BJP’s prime-ministerial candidate (in 2013-14) used to travel in a prominent businessman’s aircraft.",2018-07-30 19:26:00+05:30,, It has taken Modi four years to defend his belief in crony capitalism | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

159,Rajeev Khanna,"Political crisis and Aam Aadmi Party ( ) in Punjab have moved hand in hand. As the party stares at a vertical split there is a pertinent question that has raised its head -- Is it time to write off AAP in Punjab? The question has to be answered because the state will be voting for its 13 Lok Sabha member in less than a year. At a time when the the party should be coming out with strategies to woo the voter on the ground its members are locked in a fight that is heading towards a split in the ranks. The fresh avalanche to hit AAP came with the party in-charge for Punjab   tweeting last week about the decision to replace the Leader of Opposition in Punjab Sukhpal Singh Khaira with a Dalit face Harpal Singh Cheema. There have been many reasons being attributed to Khaira's removal. One of them was his 'support' to the 'Referendum 2020' being planned by hardline Sikhs living abroad. No amount of clarifications issued by him have worked as his detractors pounced upon the opportunity to discredit him. The second reason being attributed is Khaira not getting along well with the Sangrur MP and senior party leader Bhagwant Mann. He has also been accused of not listening to anyone's advice and going ahead with what he thinks is right. Khaira was also among those who did not approve of AAP's national convener and Delhi Chief Minister   tendering an apology to senior Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia for leveling accusations against him with regards to the prevalent drug menace ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls. As expected Khaira did not take his removal lying down. Instead he has turned it into a fight for autonomy for the Punjab unit of the party. He has planned a volunteers' convention in Bathinda on Thursday where majority of the AAP MLAs are expected to be present. This will be a show of strength in the face of the 'dictatorial' approach of the national leadership of the party sitting in Delhi. Backed by several MLAs, Khaira has already demanded his reinstatement as Leader of Opposition. Khaira has the support of the NRI volunteers of the party. These NRIs based in North America, Europe, Australia and New Zealand recently wrote to the AAP MLAs in Punjab asking them to stand by Khaira in this hour of crisis. Their letter that was circulated in the social media read, “With much due respect, we are very disappointed with recent activities in AAP Punjab units. We all NRIs worked very hard for four years and tried to support you all thru fund raising efforts, walked as volunteers on the ground with you all and executed calling campaigns to convince voters to vote for you all. We have witnessed our big Punjab leadership shrunk to almost zero.” The letter further said, “It is time to show that for us Punjab is above everything. People of Punjab showed utmost faith in all of you and now it is your time to stand with people of Punjab. We are requesting you all please stand with Khaira and stand with Punjab and our all 19-20 teams will support you guys fully.” The series of developments unfolding now were expected to unfold at the time of Kejriwal tendering the apology to Majithia. But it was clear at that point of time that things would go this way sooner or later. The issue of autonomy for the Punjab leadership had started dogging AAP ahead of the last state assembly polls when the issue of distribution of tickets had come up. Just before the time of the ouster of Succha Singh Chhotepur as the state unit chief murmurs of dissent had started against the dominance of the volunteers who had come from outside. The local leadership wanted a greater say in the distribution of tickets and there were all sorts of allegations against Sanjay Singh and Durgesh Pathak who had been sent by the party to establish the organizational network in Punjab. Things had started going downhill from the time Chhotepur was removed and the slide has not stopped till date. Once the party blew up its chances of coming to power in Punjab, even the Delhi leadership stopped taking keen interest in the developments in Punjab. In the present context one needs to look into two simultaneous political developments that have a bearing on the party affairs in Punjab. There is a point of view that the national leadership of the party is right now too focused on Delhi for both the Lok Sabha polls and the subsequent assembly polls. AAP wants to retain power in Delhi and do well in the Lok Sabha polls. It is clear that the party is in no position to repeat its 2014 Lok Sabha performance in Punjab when it won four of the 13 seats in a 'Modi wave'. Two of its Lok Sabha MPs Dr Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Singh Khalsa have been suspended by the party. Gandhi has already floated a Punjab Manch which is expected to become a political party in the days to come. He released its 'Punjab Declaration' on Tuesday playing up need for genuine federalism in the country. On his role in context of AAP, he said, “I even voted according to the whip issued by the party for the recent no confidence motion against the   led central government. When it comes to the issue of autonomy for Punjab I do not differ with Khaira.” The second issue that is plaguing the AAP leadership is the possibility of an alliance with the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls. There are many within the party who are open to the idea of this alliance as this would lead to a seat arrangement in Punjab wherein the party can expect to retain a couple of seats despite playing the second fiddle to the Congress. Observers say that in Delhi it would be a role reversal where AAP might call the shots in the event of such an alliance coming into existence. Meanwhile, all the eyes are now on Khaira's convention in Bathinda and its outcome that will decide whether AAP survives or gets divided in the state..",2018-08-01 18:55:00+05:30,, AAP headed for a split in Punjab: Is it time to write it off in the state? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
160,Akash Bisht,"With General Elections less than a year away, news reports have emerged that the   (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ),   and   (RLD) have reached a broad agreement over seat sharing in Uttar Pradesh. These parties have been in talks with each other to stitch together a grand alliance to take on the   (BJP) in the most politically significant state, which sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha. Not only UP, the parties have also been in talks over seat sharing for the upcoming Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. However, the talks have hit rough weather with Congress not ceding to the demands of its possible allies. It is for this reason that SP leadership debunked these reports and claimed that talks over seat sharing are being held only with the BSP and RLD. A senior SP leader vehemently denied such “rumors” and said they were based on “WhatsApp forwards” rather than on ground reality. “They can conjure any numbers they want. As far as SP is concerned, we have not had any such talks. Congress' arrogance in allotting respectable seats to alliance partners for upcoming Assembly polls in other states has led to an impasse. They want more than what they deserve in UP and are not ready to accommodate their partners in other states. Even Mayawatiji is facing similar trouble with Congress,” he said. He further added that it didn't make any sense to have an alliance with Congress in UP considering the Grand Old Party is more of a liability than an asset. “By giving Congress seats, there is a risk factor involved. Their recent performances in UP is a case in point. They cited similar reasons to not give us seats in other states where they seem to be in powerful position. So, why should we be so accommodating? If Congress wants to defeat BJP then it should not have different parameters for every state. Either we are in this together or we are not. They should clarify their stand,” he said.  Adding to it, he mentioned that at present the SP leadership doesn't feel the need to hold talks with the Congress. “Having any sort of seat sharing formula with the party will only hurt us,” he claimed. It is for this reason, he said that it is not even considering holding talks with the Congress. “We have adopted the policy of keeping away from Congress,” he said.  Meanwhile, Congress is facing similar trouble with BSP over seat sharing in the three states, particularly MP. Sources said the BSP has demanded 50 seats in the state, which has unnerved the Congress leadership leading to a delay in the final announcement. Congress is ready to offer a maximum of 30 seats, which is not acceptable to the BSP which wants similar alliance in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh as well. In the 2013 assembly elections in MP, the BSP secured a 7% vote share, which combined with Congress' 37% could give BJP a tough fight which had 44% share. The party, led by  , contested 227 seats and won just four seats. They managed to get 20,000 votes on 17 seats while secured 10,000 votes in 62 seats. Meanwhile, SP contested on 164 seats failed to win a seat with a total vote share of 1.2%. Moreover, Congress has already sealed a deal with Gondwana Gantantra Party that had secured 1% vote share in the 2013 Assembly polls. Having been in power for three consecutive terms, the BJP is facing massive anti-incumbency in MP which reflected in multiple protests by farmers across the state. For Congress, it is crucial to reach an understanding with the SP and the BSP if it hopes to dethrone the BJP in 2019 and to do that it will have to shed its big brother attitude and accommodate allies in other states. The foundation of a grand alliance in UP in 2019 will depend on how Congress treats its allies or else it will have to be at the mercy of the SP and the BSP. SP leaders have time and again reiterated how Congress on its own would not be able to win even the twin Lok Sabha constituencies held by Sonia and  .",2018-07-31 19:26:00+05:30,, Samajwadi debunks reports of deal with Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

165,Rajeev Khanna,"Till now it has primarily been the   (BJP) that has effectively used the Ganga for its political campaign. Right from Prime Minister   who had contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Varanasi telling his supporters that Mother Ganga had called him to the city there have been several others in his party who have been seeking votes in the name of programmes like 'Namami Gange' and making announcements of developing Ganga riverfront like the one developed on the Sabarmati in Gujarat. But now it is the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) in Haryana that is out to make use of the same Ganga to take on its opponents in the run up to the Lok Sabha and subsequent state Assembly polls next year. The volunteers of the party in Haryana under the leadership of Naveen Jaihind have embarked on a 500 km long 'Bhaichara Kanwar Yatra' in the state. Starting from Haridwar in Uttarakhand on July 31, the party volunteers are using the annual 'Kanwar Yatra' to give out a political message. They have collected the water of river Ganga which is perceived to be holy in small plastic containers which they intend to give to the top functionaries of the ruling BJP government under Manohar Lal Khattar along with their other political opponents. “The purpose is to tell these people to protect the common bhaichara (social fabric) of the state that they have destroyed through their acts. We will hand over these bottles to Khattar and others while reminding them of their promises and responsibilities towards the people of the state. We will ask them not to cheat the people. We will ask them to desist from playing the politics of region, caste and religion,” said Jaihind during the Yatra's stopover at Chandigarh on Friday. He disclosed that the Yatra will culminate at the Shaheed and Swatantrata Senani Smarak at Maharishi Dayanand University in Rohtak on August 9. “In the last four years the BJP regime has encouraged caste differences to play out and has thus destroyed the social fabric comprising 36 Biradris (communities) in the state. When the rioting was on during the Jat reservation stir and the Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) were trying to reap political dividends from the turmoil AAP was carrying on a 'Meri Jaati-Hindustani' campaign in Rohtak. We have now started this Bhaichara Kanwar Yatra involving the people of all the 36 communities and faiths,” he added. He has listed to whom and why the AAP volunteers want to hand over the small bottles of Gangajal along with packets of prasad that they are carrying from Haridwar. They want Khattar to ensure rule of law in the state where he has stood unraveled time and again on the issue of maintaining law and order. They want health minister Anil Vij to treat the hospitals that are functioning like sick units. AAP wants education minister Ram Bilas Sharma to improve the lot of government schools. The AAP volunteers want agriculture minister Anil Dhankad to address the concerns of the farmers. They will also be asking the finance minister Captain Abhimanyu to devise a strategy to make Haryana debt free by generating Rs 150 lakh crore. Jaihind said that the Gangajal will also be sent to the BJP MP from Kurukshetra Raj Kumar Saini so that he may desist from spewing venom against the Jat community. Also on radar of AAP are the Jat leader Yash Pal Malik and the top leadership of INLD and the Congress. AAP is trying to get a foothold in Haryana politics where it sees a window of opportunity to expand its base. It is primarily trying to target the areas around Delhi that form a part of the National Capital Region (NCR) by selling the Delhi model of governance introduced by it.",2018-08-04 18:28:00+05:30,, Haryana AAP gives BJP a taste of its own Gangajal | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

He arguably ruffled quite a few feathers within the  , in power at the Centre, when he quashed President's Rule in Uttarakhand iin 2016. Notwithstanding the anguish expressed by many, including several SC judges, Justice Joseph was administered the oath of office by Chief Justice Dipak Misra at a function in the apex court, following Justices Indira Banerjee and Vineet Saran. This order of seniority was the same as notified by the government in its Warrant of Appointment, which had prompted many to claim the   government was “undermining of his seniority”. it rejected the SC Collegium’s recommendation to elevate Justice Joseph as a judge of the apex court. Justice Joseph, the longest-serving chief justice of any high court was recommended by the Collegium in January. But the Centre after sitting over the recommendations for a considerable time, in July asked the collegium for reconsideration citing among other reasons his rank (45th) in the overall seniority list of high court judges. The Centre’s delayed response and sending the recommendation for reconsideration had irked the collegium members, including Justices J Chelameswar (since retired), Kurian Joseph and MB Lokur, who had expressed their anguish to Chief Justice Dipak Misra over the issue. Only after the collegium reiterated in July its recommendation to elevate Justice Joseph along with chief justice of Madras High Court Indira Banerjee and chief justice of Odisha High Court Vineet Saran as Supreme Court judges, that the Centre relented and accepted the recommendations. However, Centre put Justice Joseph’s name in third position after the other two judges in the order of appointment leading many to cry foul. Following the issue of the order of appointment several apex court judges went to CJI Misra seeking Justice Joseph be administered oath ahead of the other two judges as his name recommended much earlier than the other two judges. But on Tuesday there was no change in the order of the swearing in and Justice Jospeh took oath as the junior most judge of the apex court. The Centre has defended the decision insisting that both Justice Banerjee and Justice Saran were senior to Justice Joseph as high court judges. The order of the swearing-in prompted the Congress to smell “vindictiveness” by the BJP government. Kapil Sibal called it a black day in the history of the court.Speaking in the same vein, his colleague Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the decision was a punishment by the government for Justice Joseph: The Congress also took to twitter to express its anguish over the decision: However, there are others who have held the decision to administer oath last to Justice Joseph contending that the other two judges were senior to him as high court judges.  International Council of Jurists President Adish C Aggarwala said the government was justified in naming Justice Joseph as the third and last judge in the swearing in list. “Just because his name was recommended by the collegium earlier doesn’t means he becomes senior to other two judges. While Justice Banerjee was appointed a high court judge on 5 February, 2002 and Justice Saran on 14 February, 2002, Justice Joseph made it to the high court only on 14 October, 2004. The other two judges are fairly senior to him and administering oath to Justice Joseph first would have been a gross injustice to the other two,” Aggarwala told Catch. Former Delhi High Court judge Justice SN Dhingra too said it was appropriate that Justice Joseph was administered the oath in the last: “Seniority as a high court judge is what matters and in that respect both Justice Banerjee and Justice Saran are senior to Justice Jospeh. Just because you are a favourite of the collegiums or your name was recommended earlier doesn’t mean you can undermine that seniority. Administering oath to Justice Joseph in the last was the apt thing to do,” Justice Dhingra told  . With the elevation of the three new judges, the apex court judges strength has now gone up to 28 (against a sanctioned strength of 31). Also, for the first time the Supreme Court has three sitting women judges – Justices R Banumathi, Indu Malhotra and Indira Banerjee.",2018-08-07 17:34:00+05:30,, Justice Joseph inducted juniormost SC judge amid raging seniority debate | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
168,Speed News Desk,"There was jubilant celebration a fortnight back  when the Supreme Court  pronounced an order  that the ban imposed by the National Green Tribunal(NGT)on protests and demonstrations outside Jantar Mantar, New Delhi would be lifted; that there could not be a blanket restriction on citizens right to assemble and protest peacefully. It  also allowed demonstrations at the Boat Club, restricted to protestors since the 1990s. Boat Club, and later Jantar Mantar have been important sites of innumerable protests and sit-ins, emerging as established spaces for expression of dissent and free speech. Many have led to significant legislation, policy, public and civil action.While ruling on the petitions challenging the blanket ban on Jantar Mantar and the illegal perpetual imposition of Section 144 on most of New Delhi, the Supreme Court said that “The right to protest is, thus, recognised as a fundamental right under the Constitution. This right is crucial in a democracy which rests on participation of an informed citizenry in governance. This right is also crucial since it strengthens representative democracy by enabling direct participation in public affairs where individuals and groups are able to express dissent and grievances, expose the flaws in governance and demand accountability from State authorities as well a powerful entities. This right is crucial in a vibrant democracy like India but more so in the Indian context to aid in the assertion of the rights of the marginalised and poorly represented minorities.” This is an important concession on the fundamental right to protest as a part of Article 19(1) a & b of the Constitution. It is therefore a critical judgement and affirms the chapter on fundamental rights which has always protected violation of citizens’ democratic interests across the board. There have been a series of restrictions and violations of free speech and expression. The audacity of the establishment is apparent in the steady planned encouragement of these erosions of a critical fundamental right, with the definite purpose of weakening the Constitution and the voice of people. That is why people from all sectors-- writers, playwrights, film makers, philosophers, political thinkers, students, academic institutions, political dissenters and many more who have the ear of the people— have been threatened by anti-social elements  and the government has kept very quiet. The attack on the use of public space followed as the final stroke in a series of anti-democratic restrictions. Steadily and systematically the space of protest began shrinking and this government did the ultimate in supporting the declaration  that such places would be banned.  The right to freedom of expression anchors all other rights. Without the right to speak, demonstrate, protest and dissent, how will people in a democracy present a critique of unconstitutional and anti-democratic governance and the violation of the rule of law, social violence and discrimination, and violence?  In opening up both Boat Club and Jantar Mantar the Supreme Court reaffirms that the right to peaceful protest is a cherished fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. This assertion is of even greater significance in the current environment where critical voices are being silenced. In the Court’s own words, “Legitimate dissent is a distinguishable feature of any democracy.” However, the judgment falls short of providing effective remedy against the executive power in imposing Section 144 restrictions on the rights of peaceful assemblies. The Court has directed police authorities to frame guidelines for peaceful demonstrations, while the same authorities have been responsible for imposing excessive restrictions. The core question related to the perpetual and illegal imposition of Section 144 in Central Delhi still remains.  In the order, it is obvious that it gives us restricted and regulated access. There are rules and regulations which the police will frame--to  decide, whether the protest is  “innocuous” enough. “The underlying message is that certain categories of  peaceful protests and demonstrations, in a guarded and regulated manner, could be allowed so as to enable the protestors to exercise their right and, at the same time, ensuring that no inconvenience of any kind is caused to the residents.” The Supreme Court’s judgment reiterates once more that the right to protest is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to freedom of peaceful assembly. It is now the duty of the government to ensure that these rights are protected.  There is a difference between the State and an elected government. This government is undermining the Constitution which in fact defines the state, and directs government action. The constitutional guarantees are crucial in a country where basic promises of freedom remain a dream, and where corruption and arbitrary use of power make a mockery of the governance. Amendments to the Constitution and the law invite protest and uproar from people who do not want the changes. If the Central Government steadily undermines these rights, it could and it does change the nature of the state. The state has to remain within the constitutional framework of a democratic republic. Weakening the constitution and the framework of justice in the conception of the state is dangerous. Public protest is sacrosanct, particularly in a country which is victim to all kinds of discrimination, as both a tool and a monitor of the health of the Republic.",2018-08-06 19:20:00+05:30,, When the Supreme Court Upheld the Right to Protest | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
169,Catch Team,"Muthuvel Karunanidhi died Tuesday evening, drawing to close an era in Indian politics. He was 94. Popularly known as 'Kalaignar' – the artist – Karunanidhi was one of the tallest leaders in Indian politics, one of the stewards of the Dravidian self-respect movement, and at the same time, an important contributor to Tamil popular culture.  Thousands hit the streets in Chennai after Kauvery Hospital, where the veteran leader was being treated, announced that he died at 6:10 pm.Politicians from across the spectrum paid their respect to the leader, who served as Tamil Nadu's five separate terms and never lost an election. Leading them was Prime Minister  . As a script writer he would have lived a life of obscurity in the shadows of film stars who enjoy cult status in Tamil Nadu. But sharp-tongued, quick-witted M Karunanidhi had other plans. He outshone many a celebrity, as he presided over the destiny of the Dravidian state along with his tinsel town co-travellers and arch rivals in politics -- MG Ramachandran and his protegee J   -- for decades.  That art and politics blended seamlessly in Karunanidhi was manifest from the sobriquets of 'Thalaivar' (The Leader) and 'Kalaignar' (The Artist) he earned from ardent followers. A masterful practitioner of modern-day politics, he wielded considerable influence beyond his own state, in the corridors of power in New Delhi, for a long time, sewing up alliances with both the Congress and the BJP, often drawing criticism from his rivals, who called him an opportunist. Muthuvel Karunanidhi, who became the chief minister five times, cut his teeth in politics as a 14-year-old when he participated in the anti-Hindi agitation in 1938 at his native Tiruvarur. Hugely influenced by the rationalist and egalitarian ideology of EV Ramasamy 'Periyar' and DMK founder and the state's first chief minister CN Annadurai, Karunanidhi became one of the most enduring mascots of the Dravidian Movement, which aimed at seeking equal rights for the depressed sections and women, and was against Brahminism. Elected to the Legislative Assembly 13 times, Karunanidhi, a political artiste, outmanoeuvred VR Nedunchezhian to become the chief minister for the first time following the death of Annadurai in February 1969. MG Ramachandran, his junior and one of the most charismatic actors of his time, supported Karunanidhi in his endeavour to edge past Nedunchezhian, who was the number two in the Annadurai cabinet. Years later, the two were to part ways, with MGR, as Ramachandran was popularly called, forming the  , the party which was to become a perennial thorn in Karunanidhi's side.  Karunanidhi was a legislator for six decades since 1957, when he won for the first time from Kulithalai constituency, till 2016, when he emerged victorious from Tiruvarur as a 92-year-old, barring the period between 1986 and 1989.  In 1984, he was elected to the Legislative Council, which was abolished by the MGR government in 1986. He had resigned as MLA in 1983 over the Srilankan Tamils issue.  After assuming the reins of the government, Karunanidhi became the DMK chief in July 1969, a post that he held till death.  He again became the chief minister in 1971, 1989, 1996 and 2006. When he lost power to friend-turned-foe MGR's protegee Jayalalithaa in 2011, he famously quipped ""people have given me some rest"".  Addressed as Mu Ka, Tamil abbreviation of his name, by his peers, Karunanidhi's letters to DMK cadres in party mouthpiece Murasoli and his autobiography-cum-commentary on contemporary politics Nenjukku Needhi, are the favourite reading material for his supporters.  Karunanidhi's famous line ""  (my dear brothers in party who are are above my life),"" in his unmistakable baritone, used to send DMK workers into raptures Alongside Annadurai, who also had film and theatre background, Karunanidhi used the medium for furthering his political ideology Incidentally, the screenplay and dialogue for MGR's debut movie as hero 'Rajakumari' was written by him. He also wrote the dialogues for 'Parasakthi', the debut film of another tinsel town icon Sivaji Ganesan. The movie propagated the socialist and rationalist ideals of the Dravidian Movement.  While MGR rose to become one of the most popular public figures in Tamil Nadu's history, Ganesan dabbled in politics but faded from the scene quickly.  Karunanidhi penned screenplays and dialogues for over 50 movies. He also wrote the stories of some of them like Marudanattu Ilavarasi (1950) Mandiri Kumari (1950), Tirumbipar (1953), Arasilangkumari (1961).  A big political jolt for Karunanidhi came when MGR rebelled against him in 1972, accusing him of corruption and demanding details of the party's finances. MGR was expelled from the party the same year, and he floated the AIADMK, an event that marked the advent of bipolar politics in Tamil Nadu.  MGR led AIADMK to victory in the party's debut Assembly polls in 1977, and in 1980 and 1985. He was the chief minister till his death in 1987, forcing Karunanidhi to cool his heels in the opposition as long as he helmed the state.  Karunanidhi was back in power in 1989, only to lose to J Jayalalithaa, MGR's protegee, in 1991. He led DMK to victory in 1996, but AIADMK under Jayalalithaa trumped his party once again in 2001.  The Thalaivar struck back, wresting power from her in 2006, but the DMK lost successive Assembly polls in 2011 and 2015 to the AIADMK under a charismatic Jayalalithaa.  Proving true the adage that there are no permanent friends or foes in politics, Karunanidhi, who denounced the Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975, formed alliances with the Congress several times, and the UPA government had several ministers from the DMK. The DMK was also a constituent of the BJP-led NDA and had ministers in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Cabinet.  The DMK had walked out of the UPA 2 in 2013 over its ""soft stand"" on the atrocities on Sri Lankan Tamils in the United Nations.  The Dravidian party wanted a strongly worded resolution to be passed at the United Nations Human Rights Council, with inclusion of expressions like ""genocide"" and ""war crimes"", while seeking an international probe against Sri Lanka over persecution of Tamils in that country.  The UPA government, however, survived with the outside support of the   and  's  .  Karunanidhi suffered a personal jolt when his MP daughter Kanimozhi got embroiled in the 2G spectrum scam along with union minister and DMK leader A Raja.  In 1980, when he joined hands with the Congress, he exuded warmth for Indira Gandhi with his remark, ""  (welcome, the daughter of Nehru, give us good governance).""  The comment encapsulated the intrinsic resilience of the master political craftsman who saw opportunity in every adversity. - ",2018-08-07 18:58:00+05:30,, End of an era: 'Kalaignar' Karunanidhi dies | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
170,Charu Kartikeya,"The defeat in the election of the deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha appears to be a result of the Opposition camp’s own making. It was a close contest and victory could have been ensured with careful planning and pragmatic strategy. However, the Congress-led Opposition failed to grasp the gravity of the situation and act in time. NDA nominee,   (United)'s Harivansh, emerged victorious, winning 125 votes. Opposition nominee, BK Hariprasad of the Congress, got 105 votes. The 20-vote margin included three from the Aam Aadmi Party ( ), two from YSR Congress and two from  's People's Democratic Party (PDP), who abstained from voting. Their reasons: The PDP said the United Progressive Alliance did not approach it to vote for its candidate, The AAP had said it wanted Congress President   to call up party chief   and YSRCP said it wanted the Opposition to field a non-Congress candidate. But for the Congress’ adamance, these were not particularly harsh demands. Accommodation would have also signalled the way forward for Opposition unity for the Lok Sabha polls.

Add the seven votes held by the three abstaining parties and the tally could have gone up to 119, very close to the magic number of 123 required to win. As the largest party in the Opposition, the Congress will have to take the blame for this defeat. It is actually surprising why the party didn’t fight harder to retain the post that has been with it for over four decades. Was a phone call to Kejriwal or Mufti too steep a price? To win over YSRCP, it could have fielded a non-Congress candidate. The party would have lost the post but its camp could have won it.

171,Rajeev Khanna,"Former Prime Minister and   (BJP) stalwart is no more and, going with the times, most media outlets are leaving no stone unturned to to make a God of him. Undoubtedly, he was a leader of tall stature, the like of whom does not exist among the current lot. His contributions to the nation can be left to the history and the people to judge. But while writing his obituary it needs to be kept in mind how people and communities looked at him. This reporter will try to bring out this aspect from some of the areas he covered as he tried to gather insights into Vajpayee's personality. Let's start with hilly Himachal Pradesh, the state the deceased PM referred to as his “second home”. His annual sojourns at Prini village near Manali in Kullu district are fondly remembered by the people of the state. After all, he belonged to that rare breed of politicians who, while holding the top office, would agree to be a chief guest at the annual day of a primary school in a neighbouring village. The chief guests at such functions are normally Tehsildars and village Pradhans. Vajpayee had obliged those present at the function by reciting a couple of his poems: While humbly saying, “  (I am not a poet).” He had instead laid stress on regaling them with anecdotes from his past. “What stood out was the fact that the children and the common people present saw him more as a prominent tall personality than a man holding the powerful post of the prime minister,” said a senior journalist who covered three of Vajpayee's Prini sojourns. “The people felt at ease with him and even transgressed the lines to ask him personal questions. He would not disappoint them. Once someone asked him whether he would return as the Prime Minister after 2004 Lok Sabha elections and he had replied with humour that the question was as hypothetical as his getting married,” he narrated. He recalls how Vajpayee had used his trade mark style to confess that Gujarat riots had been a major cause for BJP's defeat in the 2004 polls. “We had asked him about the impact of Gujarat on results and he replied in his trademark style ' ' (The only impact was that we lost he polls),” he said. On one occasion Vajpayee gave a story to the Press by taking his family for a meal at an Italian restaurant at Manali specialising in pizzas. It was a time when most leaders of his party were ranting about the Italian origins of the then-Congress President  . People of Himachal and Uttarakhand will always remember Vajpayee for the special economic package that saw arrival of industry on a large scale thus providing them both with revenue as well as employment opportunities.  Uttarakhand was carved out as a new state, along with Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, under his regime. People remember him for helping them realise their dream of a hill state; although it is a different matter that successive governments and bureaucrats have made a complete mess of things there. Another unique gift that he gave to the hill state was restoration of the Naini Lake in Nainital that is the economic life line of the local community. The gift was unique in a way that it involved pumping of oxygen under water so that the aqua life could survive. It was only after the intervention of the Supreme Court that the Lake Development Authority (LDA) had started taking pro active measures to conserve the fragile ecology of the town. But there are communities that have their reservations about Vajpayee while not denying that he was a towering leader. In Punjab, organisations like Dal Khalsa have “bitter” memories of his attitude and role towards Sikhs. “The moment his name comes in our mind, it reminds us how he led BJP protesters on 3 May, 1984 in Delhi, pressing the then central government to send the Indian army to 'liberate the Golden Temple from anti-national people' as claimed and written by his closest colleague LK Advani in his book,” Dal Khalsa leader Kanwarpal Singh said. “Vajpayee’s name also reminds us that after the Army attack in June 1984, when he visited Amritsar that August, he justified the assault and rubbed salt on our wounds by saying 'this attack should have happened six months ago',” Singh added. According to him: “In 1999, during the tercentenary celebrations of Khalsa Panth, as Prime Minister, he released Rs 100 crore to the RSS to penetrate into Sikh rank and file under the pretext of the celebrations. With that huge amount at its disposal, the RSS unleashed cultural terrorism against Sikhs through various means and ways.” He was also critical of Vajpayee's role in the context of the anti-Muslim pogrom in Gujarat.  At the same time, few remember that Vajpayee reportedly made a last-ditch effort to save former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's assassin Kehar Singh from the gallows. Gujarat is another state where the Muslim community – the victim of the 2002 riots following the Godhra carnage – along with social activists and people believing in diversity and pluralism have their reservations about him. The sentiment among these communities is that despite the 'Raj Dharma' rebuke at the then CM Modi on the handling of situation after the Godhra train burning episode, Vajpayee did not ensure that the 'Raj Dharma' was demonstrated on the ground. A social media post that is being circulated about Vajpayee's role says, “He came, he saw, he concurred.” When Vajpayee inaugurated the Ahmedabad Vadodara Express Highway, the first stretch of the ambitious Golden Quadrilateral Project at Narol in January 2003, he had said the-then American President George Bush was not going in the right direction as America prepared for the Iraq invasion. The local Muslim population had smirked, saying that while he could not get his own party chief minister to prevent the killings in Gujarat, he was asking American President not to invade Iraq. This reporter recalls how on 13 January, 2004, Vajpayee in a late-evening address at the GMDC Grounds in Ahmedabd had again used his trade mark style to woo the Muslim community ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Having talked of various things he suddenly came up with his trademark pause before saying what had happened was wrong and after another pause ' ' (They should forgive). In his ambiguous trademark style he had sought an apology from the victim community. He had then gone on to inaugurate a state-of-the-art hospital in Bhuj that was built with funds from his his office after the Bhuj earthquake of 2001. At this event in Bhuj, Modi had broken down while underlining how much Vajpayee had meant for him. ",2018-08-20 14:05:00+05:30,, Bittersweet PM: The memories of Vajpayee  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

174,Pradeep Narayanan,"One cannot live for 95 years, of which more than 70 years was in active partisan politics, and yet not be disliked by most people, if not everyone. Being in active politics, one would have taken innumerable political stands and with every new one, would have made new enemies. Further, for every political compromise one would have made for getting to power, there would be ten times those to sustain power. And then, his longevity would leave him struggling to list even one principle that he preached and did not violate at least once in his life. Yet, history could never be able to ignore him easily, simply because for most of the era when he had power, there were no better role models anyway. That is Karunanidhi!  With him ended the glorious era of Dravidian Troika - with Periyar and Annadurai. The three presided over probably the only successful social transformation, which owes to a socio-political movement, and resulted in even usurping of power by the then marginalised section through a political process acknowledged as democracy. Karunanidhi was way older than he was- at any point of his life. His intellectual grasp over social concepts and sarcastic retorts that are grounded in the realities made even his peers regard him as an old wise man. He was never young for any generation of youths. A generation of youth saw in him an experienced political and progressive artist; the next one called him a revolutionary leader; the subsequent one saw themselves as his benefactor; and some among the current youth saw in him a sentinel- to ward off any attempt to revive any brahmanical narrative that the troika always fought against. The Dravidian movement, the first time, successfully used people’s mobilisation to win electoral power for a marginalised community. It displaced a system that perpetuated one minuscule sections’ dominance over policy-making spaces so much that the knowledge system around that power structure created a narrative that such kind of knowledge-based caste hierarchy is legitimate. The concept of merit, pedigree, hygiene, non-violence, karma - were all instruments that legitimated the illegitimate dominance of the so-called top most ladder of caste system. The inequality was so ingrained in the culture and society, that it produced a polity of inequity very legitimately. And this polity controlled the culture and this culture controlled the polity - and together they perpetuated an unequal system, but in a very organic way. Knowledge was the power and also the instrument to legitimise the illegitimate power-at the same time. A hundred years ago, in 1919, out of 128 district munsifs, 93 were Brahmins: 609 out of 1007 gazettes posts were held by Brahmins; 9813 out of 17225 clerks were Brahmins; and not a single non-Brahmin was elected to the Legislative Council between 1887 and 1917. In 1914, of 650 registered graduates of Madras University, 464 were Hindus, and among them only 11 were non-Brahmin Hindus. This is the context to the Dravidian movement, which began as the Justice Party. The point was to bring justice - a section that has population of 3 to 4 percent cannot occupy most of the policy-making, implementing and influencing space. And while the reservation for non-Brahmins began as early as 1920s, the struggle was to use the political space to then influence socio-cultural and religious spaces, which continues even today. And Karunanidhi and his struggle needs to be located within that space of dissent and protest, where being in power does not matter. More than the persistence, the Dravidian movement demonstrated the tactical acumen of the troika. A general statement about Tamil Nadu - cinema influences its politics - hides the way the politics of Annadurai and Karunanidhi instrumentalised Tamil cinema. Culture was an important cockpit space, and in cinema, they saw the amalgam of popular culture and popular mobilisation. Annadurai’s Vellaikaari and Or Iravu and Karunanidhi’s Parasakthi, Mandhirikumari and Thangarathnam set the tone for the movement’s influence over Tamil cinema. Karunanidhi promoted rationalist ideas and encouraged viewers to question everything. In Naam, he writes, “there is not much difference between a sickle and a question mark”. MGR’s screen dialogue is penned by Karunanidhi! Cinema was instrumental in educating masses. It took the form of student movements, cultural movements, social movements, political struggles, mass movement. You think of anything - it had characteristics of everything that is considered as progressive. One can easily infer that the Dravidian movement underestimated the caste system. Democratisation of political space stopped with displacing Brahmins from certain political spaces. Brahminism was understood narrowly, ignoring that for thousands of years, Brahminism percolated at every level of caste relationships. That the relationship between Tamil Shudras (dravidas) and Adidravidas would also be brahmanical for the relationship is in the end a byproduct of the Brahmanical caste system - was not something unknown to the troika, but their inability to create sequential successive movements stopped at a new socio-political relationship, which may not be less brahmanical than what it displaced. It was not that the need for a continued struggle was never felt, but it just stopped! Where did it falter? Firstly, the dynamics of capturing political power and sustaining political power are different. The agitators, who together built the movement, post the conquest of political power, rewarded themselves with positions - and they rested. The struggle stopped. Secondly, progressive politics became a victim of its own instruments, which legitimised power not because of ideology but because of its strength as mobiliser. Cinema as a medium to mobilise people won over it being the instrument to promote ideology, for the people were not fully prepared to stand up for the ideology. People never understood that ideology demands overhaul of power structure, which would not necessarily be comfortable for them. That a Dravidian ideology could produce MGR or Jayalalitha as its leaders - is the victory of the instrument over the ideology. While it will be unfair to dismiss Karunanidhi because of his many wrong doings, it will also be unfair not to say that Karunanidhi, in the end, did fail the movement. He will probably never be forgiven for converting an ideology-based political party that he inherited from Annadurai, into a corrupt personal fiefdom. For that crime, an Annadurai and a Periyar would never give him a space alongside their cemeteries, but his life is definitely more than these. And then, Karunanidhi, the social reformer, should refuse to die!",2018-08-07 22:17:00+05:30,," Karunanidhi: Sun sets, but a reformer never dies | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/
175,Speed News Desk,"What is the criteria for calling someone a great man? Isaiah Berlin, the Oxford philosopher/historian’s definition is in my judgement ideal. Berlin wrote, “To call someone a great man is to claim that he has intentionally taken a large step, one far beyond the normal capacities of men, in satisfying, or materially affecting, central human interests… Permanently and radically alters the outlook and values of a significant body of human beings.”I cannot claim intimacy with Atal Bihari Vajpayee. I knew him for over four decades. He had an engaging personality, verbal spontaneity, sense of humour, he was free of pomposity, was approachable, literary, had a first-rate political judgement, was an orator of the highest calibre and a skilful, disarming superb parliamentarian. I had first met him in the early 1970s. I was Ambassador to Poland. He had come to Warsaw as a member of a Parliamentary delegation. Unlike most of his colleagues he did not make outrageous demands. He was dignified and did not throw his weight around. I had a couple of worthwhile conversations with him, both about Poland and her relations with Soviet Union. I told him that Poland attached considerable importance to Indo-Polish relations, but had no independent foreign policy. The foreign policy of the East European countries, was dictated by Moscow. However, in private the Poles were not over fond of the Soviets. Atal ji left a good impression on me and his Polish hosts. He was for a short period External Affairs Minister in Morarji Desai’s rickety government. During his tenure he visited Lusaka, capital of Zambia. I took him to meet President Kaunda, who over did his praise of the Indian High Commissioner. Vajpayee did not share the enthusiasm of the Zambian President. On leaving the President’s residence, I asked the driver to drop the External Affairs Minister at his hotel. He said to me in Hindi,” aap mujhe apne ghar nahin le jainge…” (Will you not take me to your house?) I said no, not after the way your government has been treating me. “Natwar Singh is Indira Gandhi’s man etc”. From London I had been abruptly posted to Zambia. My monthly reports to the Ministry were filed not read. Vajpayee ji insisted, “I want to meet your wife. Your mother-in-law asked me to see her.” It was not the cell phone age. I telephoned my wife from the reception desk telling her to prepare lunch. For half an hour we sat in Vajpayee ji’s suite. The lunch was not a success. I did not let my diplomatic guard down. I was formal, stiff and mostly silent. He enjoyed the meal, chatted with my wife, talked about her mother. When I finally got back to Delhi in 1982 after my Islamabad posting, I saw him from time to time. He was critical of our Pakistan policy in particular. He asked about President Zia. “Why did he hang Bhutto.” I enlightened him, “Zia was a small and vengeful man.” After a minor but open tiff we got on very well. This was at an all-party meeting on Iraq in Parliament House (probably in 2001). The Congress was represented by  ,   and myself. The PM held forth on the merits of his Iraq policy. I politely contradicted him. Uncharacteristically he retorted, “Natwar Singh ji ko adat hai hamari policy ko criticize karneki”. I could have replied but restrained myself. Three days later there was a meeting at 7 Race Course Road. I was present. After the meeting as I was leaving the room, a man ran after me, “PM is calling you, Sir”. When we met, the great man won me over for life. I give the English translation of what he said, “The other day I said to you, more than I should. Please do not take it to heart.” Here is large-hearted greatness for you. His passing away, ends an era. He was an exceptional statesman.  By - K.

176,Saba Naqvi,"Shades of Saffron -- from Vajpayee to Modi(Page 16-18) Was Vajpayee really opposed to the Ram temple movement? I believe at some level there was a genuine revulsion, perhaps even aesthetic, in the way things were panning out around the mandir–masjid. I remember following him to Surat in Gujarat during the campaign trail. One day, even as he stepped out of his car, a volunteer who appeared to be in a state of frenzy, began shouting, ‘Jai Shri Ram’ (Hail, Shri Ram). I vividly recall Vajpayee turning around and snapping rather poetically, ‘Bolte raho Jai Shri Ram; aur karo mat koi kaam!’ (Keep shouting Jai Shri Ram; do little else)! It was one of those Vajpayee moments I shall always remember. Around the same time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee granted me an interview, which was published in India Today magazine where I then worked, as part of one of the first cover stories I wrote on the BJP. We spoke about many things, but the major thrust of the interview was that he wished to separate the BJP from RSS. ‘It is ridiculous to say that the BJP would be remote controlled by the RSS. The RSS has views of its own. The BJP has views of its own. And the BJP is adjusting to a more real situation.’ Another memory from the 1998 campaign is of the time when a reporter asked the BJP’s prime minister-designate point-blank (which seems impossible to do these days) what if his party lost the elections. Unfazed, and with a twinkle in his eyes, Vajpayee had retorted, ‘Then it will be agli bari, Atal Bihari’ (The next time over, Atal Bihari Vajpayee; the campaign slogan in 1998 was, Abki bari Atal Bihari, this time around, it’s Atal Bihari). It was this self-deprecating humour in Hindi that made the man stand out among conventional politicians. On 4 December 1997, the then President of India, K. R. Narayanan dissolved the 11th Lok Sabha. There was a certain irony in the fact that it coincided with the BJP holding its first all-India Muslim Youth Conference at a stadium in Delhi. Vajpayee couldn’t resist cracking a joke even on that day—‘People may suggest that we have an understanding with the President to dissolve the Lok Sabha on the day we have our first Muslim conference.’ I remember being told by party cadre how they had instructions not to raise the ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan. Naturally, I attended the event and was quite amused to see silence on Ram, but leader after leader going up on stage and reciting Urdu couplets, showering praises on Muslim heroes, many I hadn’t even ever heard of.   proceeded to give examples of India’s composite culture: he spoke of Hindus visiting Sufi shrines, and Meo Muslims.* K. R. Malkani, veteran Jana Sangh leader, who at that time headed the Deendayal Research Institute, came up with two gems which I dutifully noted in my reporter’s notebook—‘Ram–Rahim ek hain, Krishna–Kaaba ek hain,’ (Ram and Rahim, as Krishna and Kaaba are one and the same), he said in the spirit of oneness. But the very next line had prompted Atalji to stare at Malkani, who said, ‘No Muslim will oppose Atalji even if he stands from Islamabad.’ However, the news point for me that day was a significant statement by L. K. Advani who appealed to Muslims to give up their claim on the Babri masjid in Ayodhya, while assuring them that he would personally negotiate with the VHP to find a settlement to the Kashi and Mathura disputes. In 1998, Atal Bihari Vajpayee traversed the country making meaningful speeches about swasthya, shiksha and suraksha (health, education and security). He openly admitted to being irritated by questions about the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the Uniform Civil Code, or the revival of the Hindu rashtra. Even occasional queries about Kashi and Mathura would irk him no end, and he would choose to keep silent. However, it was also true that the building of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya was a core issue that the BJP couldn’t afford to ignore, as it had contributed to its great electoral leap in 1991. Vajpayee therefore made a subtle change in tack and said that it was no longer necessary for a BJP government to enact a legislation to build a temple at Ayodhya. ‘We will resolve the issue through dialogue—the same way we resolved the Azadari dispute between the Shias and Sunnis of Lucknow. A law will not be needed.’  Lord Ram could never be jettisoned by the BJP. There were other voices like that of Kushabhau Thakre, who later became party president—‘Can anyone think about India without Ram?’ he once asked me, but added with utmost honesty that, ‘We can only implement our ideology if we have the strength to do so.  ’ (All this is on our agenda but we lack the strength to pursue it).’ That was a euphemism for saying that their ideology will not be jettisoned, but only deferred for some more time. This shall be said many times over in the book—Vajpayee was different from the run-of-the-mill RSS worker because he perceived politics as an art of the possible. It wasn’t as if he wasn’t close to the Sangh Parivar, it was rather well known that he enjoyed a great rapport with the then RSS sarsanghchalak (supreme leader or chief), Rajju Bhaiya. That said, Vajpayee also had some contempt for those in public life who did not have the ability to win elections. He was always more comfortable in the company of former Rajasthan chief minister, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, Jaswant Singh and, later, Pramod Mahajan, all traditional politicians. One of his famous retorts to the ‘mukhauta’ controversy, hinted at his impatience towards back-room organisers such as Govind. ‘I must be enjoying the full confidence of the party or else I would never have been bestowed with the highest honour of being the prime ministerial candidate.’  Yet, among the hard-liners, Vajpayee did not come out tops. Sadhvi Rithambara, notorious for her venom-spewing remarks about Muslims during the Ram janmabhoomi movement, described him as, ‘half a Congressman’; while the then chief of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, the late Ashok Singhal, was barely on talking terms with him. As far as the Advani–Vajpayee relationship was concerned, it had layers of complexities. On the one hand, there was mutual respect based on long-standing friendship and association. Advani, typically like several RSS functionaries was adept at handling the nitty-gritty of organisational matters—something Vajpayee had no patience for. But once Vajpayee settled into the prime ministership, the question about who was more powerful remained unanswered. Advani because he had greater party and RSS backing? Or Vajpayee because he had greater mass appeal? It was the clear-headed Advani who would describe what the BJP was going through as, ‘The transformation of an ideological movement to a mass-based party. That is why there are hiccups at every stage. Take the recent agonising over the party’s manifesto. While a manifesto may be so much waste paper for most political parties, every small nuance is pored over in the BJP.’ In sum, by the time of the swearing-in ceremony on 19 March 1998, the BJP had shown far greater flexibility than it was credited with having. The umbilical cord to the RSS had not been cut, yet the Vajpayee facade was instrumental in convincing several parties to go along with the BJP. Vajpayee himself said quite artfully, ‘Sometimes circumstances may have forced us to take a hard line. But the BJP has always been a moderate party.’ There’s no denying that putting the NDA together required deft work and it revealed the political intelligence of both Advani and Vajpayee. Ironically, it was during the 1998 campaign trail that Vajpayee would frequently attack the United Front (UF) coalition (that got outside support from the Congress party) for lack of ideological clarity with lines such as, ‘Kahin ka eent, kahin ka roda, Bhanumati ne kunba joda’ (A brick from here, a brick from there, that’s how Bhanumati got her flock together). The BJP had done pretty much the same, but the difference was that they would make it work. As for the Govindacharya issue, Vajpayee would eventually deal with it with a sense of humour. There was a point when he stopped referring to Govind by his name, and would privately tell members of his inner circle how ‘Rajneeshacharya’ (reference to a godman with a large following) did this or that. Apparently, once Vajpayee genuinely forgot his name and referred to him as ‘Dronacharya’!",2018-08-17 14:40:00+05:30,," Mandir, mask and the man: Vajpayee in the reporter's eye | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/
177,Akash Bisht,"A day after   (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav backed the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government's push for 'one nation, one election', sharp divisions have emerged within the party over his stand. Sources informed that the line taken by Yadav is not the party's official stand, and a change may be on the cards once party chief and former Uttar Pradesh chief minister   returns from his trip abroad Tuesday. Senior party leaders are expected to meet Akhilesh and convey their reservation about the party endorsing simultaneous elections to the Lok Sabha and state legislatures. The SP President earlier dared the   (BJP) to implement simultaneous polls in 2019 after a electoral reforms committee, formed by the UP government, suggested that Assemblies whose term expires before 2021 can go to polls in 2019. Meanwhile, the committee further suugested that Assemblies whose term expire after 2021 can have elections in 2024. Responding to these suggestions, Akhilesh said: “We have no problems with ‘one nation one election’. I ask them to implement ‘one nation one election’ from 2019 itself and hold Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls with the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.” “Politically, it makes sense to dare the BJP government to hold Assembly elections in UP along with the upcoming General Elections in 2019. Akhilesh's reaction was confined to the committee's suggestions and also on Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) government's rising unpopularity in the state. However, to back the idea at a meeting convened by the Law Commission, cannot be party's official stand. Let Akhilesh return from his overseas trip which could see party change its position,” said a senior party leader. Another senior leader of the party claimed that no one in the party was aware that Ram Gopal would support the   government on this idea. “By supporting this idea, it seems we are also supporting the idea of holding next UP Assembly elections in 2024. I don't think this is what the party wants. We should wait for Akhilesh to return to make the party's official stand clear,” he said. The Law Commission invited recognised political parties to present their views on simultaneous elections held Saturday and Sunday. Having prepared a draft paper on 'Simultaneous Elections – Constitutional and Legal Perspectives', the Commission sought opinions of stakeholders, including political parties, constitutional experts, bureaucrats and members of the academia. Once satisfied, the Commission will prepare a report and send it to the government. Most parties opposed the idea claiming that it would subvert the Constitution by eroding India's federal structure and undermining regional aspirations. During the course of two days, Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, the Telugu Desam Party, the Bodoland People's Front, the SP, Telangana Rashtra Samithi,   (Secular), the Aam Aadmi Party, Shiromani Akali Dal, All-India Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, Biju Janata Dal, Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), Trinamool Congress, Goa Forward Party and Forward Block, appeared before the Commission. While most parties opposed the idea, the SP, SAD, BJD, TRS and the BPF favoured the idea. Except SP, these parties were expected to back the government. Therefore, SP's decision to support 'one nation, one poll' idea surprised all, considering how it has been batting for a united Opposition to take on the government over its policies and programmes. “The Samajwadi Party is in favour of simultaneous elections, but they should begin from 2019. In case public representatives switch sides or indulge in horse trading, action should be taken against them by the LG with a week,” Ram Gopal was quoted saying by ANI. The SP remains the only party from the united opposition camp to have endorsed the idea.  Meanwhile, the  , Rashtriya Janata Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party and the BJP have not stated their position on the issue as yet and have demanded for more time before making their intent clear. As far as SP is concerned, all eyes are on Akhilesh's return to see whether the party has a change of heart.",2018-07-09 16:56:00+05:30,, Ram Gopal extended support to simultaneous polls.

183,Rajeev Khanna,"Over the last few days, rumour mongering leading to lynching of the minorities and the marginalised sections of the society has become a norm. But it has assumed a new dimension in Himachal Pradesh on the issue of presumed employment of some Rohingya refugees in door to door collection in Shimla. The outcome has been spewing of venom by the Hindutva groups and organisations across the region much to the delight of the political forces keen on polarisation of the society ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It all started with a report in a vernacular daily known for its right wing stance that pointed at employment of some Rohingya refugees for garbage collection by a construction company to which the garbage collection work has been outsourced for five wards of the town namely Totu, Machyat, Boileuganj, Kacchighati and Tuti Kandi. The report was rife with the ongoing right wing slander against the Rohingya Muslims pointing at their being a threat to the country. It posed a question how they could manage to reach Shimla. This got the tongues wagging and all sorts of rumours started doing the rounds with one of them saying that someone had seen United Nations identity cards on some people. This brought a much sought opportunity for organisations like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) that were quick to lap it up. The VHP immediately issued a statement saying: “Rohingya Muslims will not be accepted in the state at any cost. There are already hundreds of Bangladeshis living illegally in Himachal and arrival of Rohingyas will be a big security threat to the state. Their being brought to Shimla as employees points to a big conspiracy.” The VHP threatened to launch an agitation if the Rohingyas were not sent back and action was not taken against the company that recruited them. The organisation demanded that the recruitment be done at the local level. The most serious aspect of the issue has been that not even a single person has come forward to say that he or she had met any Rohingyas. Things came to a pass that Shimla Mayor Kusum Sadret had to issue a statement saying that no Rohingyas had been deployed for door to door garbage collection. “We have not signed the letter of intent and the contractor has not even started the work,” she said. She said the contractor has been asked to recruit people only after police verification. “There are many questions. Who saw the Rohingyas? Who started the rumours? Did the police do any verification? The biggest issue is that is it not the job of the police to come out clarifying things?” asked former Mayor Sanjay Chauhan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). He has also accused the   (BJP)-led Shimla Municipal Corporation (SMC) first allowing a mess to be created on garbage collection and then going in for outsourcing the garbage collection in the name of the same mess thus paving the way for privatisation of the entire garbage collection mechanism. But more important is the bogey that is being created against the minorities in the hill state. Chauhan has aimed a shot at the ruling pointing, “Isn't it strange that the recruitment is being done by the RSS-BJP people sitting in the SMC and then these very same people are making a hue and cry about it. What does one make of it? Is it the preparation for 2019 ?” The kind of venom being spewed against the minorities puts to shame the people of this hill state that takes pride in calling itself a 'cultured, educated and developed' society. Those spewing venom include people from professions like teaching. It comes as a shock to read social media posts like the one saying. “  (Kill the *********. When you go for the assault please call me. My number is **********).”  This is surely not something that can be expected from people of Himachal and particularly those from Shimla. Over the last few years a hate campaign has been on in various districts of the state, particularly against the Muslims, by the right wing groups. In towns like Solan it is through sheer dint of hard work that the Muslim migrants have prospered as masons, plumbers along with other professionals required in the construction industry and also as those running the fruit and vegetable business. Most of them are from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.  The right-wing organisations have been running a whispered campaign against them often provoking the unemployed locals against them saying that these migrants have usurped what is rightfully theirs. This campaign is backed by the general campaign being carried out by the across the country by the Hindutva organizations on issues like cow vigilantism etc. Although there is hardly any Muslim population in the state, the agenda appears to keep a fear of minorities alive in the majority to achieve political goals. Barring the Left that has a presence in small pockets, no other political force has come forward to condemn these attempts at communal polarisation. While this cannot be expected from the BJP, the Congress by trying to peddle soft Hindutva too is failing the people on this count. This has left the minorities, particularly the Muslims including a large number of Kashmiris who work as labourers in the state, standing extremely vulnerable to the communal diatribe and insecurity that accompanies this campaign. Such vicious campaigns are only expected to increase as the country heads towards the Lok Sabha polls.",2018-07-10 18:26:00+05:30,, Himachal's shame: Rumour mongering against Rohingyas to achieve communal polarisation | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

185,Charu Kartikeya,"With its neglect in the last four years as a running theme, Parliament is all set to convene once again with a heavy legislative agenda. The Monsoon Session of Parliament will start Wednesday (18 July) and will carry on until 10 August, with a total of 18 sittings. An all-party meeting chaired, strangely, by Prime Minister   was held Tuesday morning where all parties reportedly aired the respective concerns that they would like to raise during the session. After the meeting, the PM and his team tried to create an impression that this session could witness greater understanding and co-operation between the treasury as well as Opposition benches. However, that seems unlikely as the political relationship between the two sides is as hostile right now as it was during the Budget Session. Indeed, at least one of the opposition leaders minced no words in saying that Parliament will not function if their demands are not met. ’s Ramgopal Yadav asserted unequivocally that the Opposition will not allow the House to function till an assurance was given by the government on reservation to SCs and STs in higher education.” This exchange will continue at the all-party meeting called by Speaker   later today, but it is unlikely that a compromise formula will emerge.

187,Rajeev Khanna,"Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh, who represents Gurugram in Lok Sabha, made headlines recently when he targetted Haryana Chief Minister Manohal Lal Khattar over caste-based discriminations. It was not the first time – In May, he gave a piece of his mind when Khattar failed to reach an event to mark four years of the   government. These instances have exposed cracks in the ruling   (BJP) in a state where Assembly elections will be due soon after next year's Lok Sabha polls. They can be embarassing for the party. All the same, there are political observers who feel otherwise: Such contrarian stands resemble the time-tested strategy of the   (RSS) of speaking in different voices to gauge the public mood and settle down at a point of convenience. Whatever be the case, Inderjit's reported outburst at a workers' meet left the Khattar regime red-faced. “... The state has seen cracks along castes in his (Khattar's) regime. No one can rule in this situation as it has taken the shape of a three-legged chair, on which no one can sit,” he said. A 'leader' should be appointed chief minister, instead of a CM learning to be a leader, Inderjit said, taking a jibe at Khatta without naming him. He also hit out at Khattar regrding the non-completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal despite the Supreme Court ruling in favour of Haryana. The Indian National Lok Dal has been playing the issue up: “Once, the CM discussed the SYL issue with me and planned to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with other Haryana leaders to seek the delegation of a central agency for ensuring the execution of the Supreme Court verdict. “I do not know whether he has met the Prime Minister or not,” he reportedly said, adding that he, along with other Parliamentarians from the state would call on Modi in the forthcoming monsoon session of the Lok Sabha to demand execution of the project. Inderjit refuted speculation over his departure from the BJP. But his attack on Khattar points to a simmering caste cauldron in Haryana. The manner in which the Khattar government dealt with the 2016 Jat agitation over reservation of seats in educational institutions and jobs deepened caste-divide. Jats stood isolated from the remaining 35 biradaris (communities) and the BJP was accused by the opposition of polarising the society for political benefits, a political analyst said. The Khattar regime was held responsible for paralysing the state administration on the ground at the peak of the violence and not reining in Kurukshetra MP Raj Kumar Saini from spewing venom against community. Some observers think Inderjit's outburst can be a ploy to consolidate his position in the state's Yadav-dominated Ahirwal region. “By praising Modi and attacking Khattar from the same platform, he has got nothing to loose,” pointed out a senior political observer Balwant Takshak. Inderjit, they said, was looking at at least one more term in the Lok Sabha MP and wants his daughter to enter the state Assembly. Such muscle flexing can help him achieve both goals.  Others think his outburst was part of the Sangh Parivar strategy of speaking in different voices. “The BJP has taken no action until date against Saini for his continuing venomous diatribe against the Jats. Inderjit talking against Khattar from a different platform is an additional voice coming from a different corner of the state. It can be a part of the strategy to get electoral returns by taking different stands and later come back together to join hands,” Takshak said. Whatever the case, by his repeated outbursts Inderjit has emerged as a leader to keep a watch on.",2018-07-17 17:51:00+05:30,, Is Rao Inderjit's outburst against Khattar genuine discontent or BJP's electoral ploy | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
188,Akash Bisht,"Showing signs of greater unity, the Opposition will bring a no-confidence motion against the NDA government over special status category to Andhra Pradesh. In the previously held Budget session, the differences within the Opposition led to three parties – Congress, TDP and YSRCP – giving separate notice for no-confidence motion. However, better sense seems to have prevailed over the opposition after Congress and 11 other parties have decided to support TDP's decision to move the motion. In fact, TDP MP Srinivas Kesineni gave notice to Lok Sabha General Secretary to include no-confidence motion in the council of ministers, in the list of business for Wednesday. In his letter, the MP wrote, “Under rule 198 (1) of Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha, I hereby give notice to move the following motion of No-Confidence in the Council of Ministers. Kindly include the same in the Revised List of Business for 18-07-2018 – This House expresses its want of confidence in the Council of Ministers.” Supporting TDP's decision, the Congress' leader of the opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the party will support the motion against the   government. “If the government does its job, it must face the motion of no-confidence. The rule says that if 54 MPs give a motion of no confidence then the chair has to admit it. There is no escape. We have witnessed in the past that even if 100 people stand in support, the motion is not accepted,” he said. The Monsoon Session beginning Wednesday will yet again see the Opposition sparring with the government over a host of issues including that of special status to Andhra Pradesh. Laying out the blueprint for the upcoming session, the Congress' Mallikarjun Kharge said that during the all party meet, a consensus was reached to raise issues that are important and in the public interest. He went on to add that during the all party meet it was decided that we will support the government to ensure a smooth functioning of the Parliament. Accusing the Prime Minister and his ministers for misleading the people over non-functioning of Parliament, Kharge said, “Whenever we raise important issues for discussion, they seek new ways to avoid it. That is why the discussion doesn't happen. Thereafter, the PM and BJP leaders blame the opposition for stalling Parliament.” Slamming the NDA for failing on all fronts, the Congress said that the Opposition would seek a debate with the government on the BJP's manifesto that it came out with in 2014. Congress claimed that the Opposition will also seek a debate on the increasing incidents of lynchings on the pretext of cow protection. The party went on to add that lynching cases have seen a spurt ever since BJP came to power in 2014. In fact, the Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Parliament to bring a special law to establishing lynching as separate offence with a harsh punishment. Kharge went on to add that a united opposition will raise other issues including rising unemployment; safety of women; misrule in J&K; restoration the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act; attempts by the government to end reservation in autonomous institutions; farmers' issues; price rise; foreign policy failures; black money; among others. Kharge added that the opposition will also try to seek answers from the government on the Ahmedabad District Cooperation Bank. According to him, Rs 750 crore were deposited in the bank five days before demonetisation was announced by the Prime Minister. Meanwhile, Azad said that the Congress will also raise the issue of alleged EVM tampering in Assembly polls and demand going back to the ballot paper system for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Both the leaders exhorted that if the no confidence motion is taken, it will lead to all these issues being discussed threadbare by the opposition. Adding to this, Azad mentioned that the Opposition has collectively identified these issues. In another development, the suspense over the members of the Congress Working Committee was finally over after the party announced names of individuals who are part of the newly constituted CWC. The party has nominated 18 CWC members along with 18 permanent invitees and 10 special invitees.",2018-07-17 22:19:00+05:30,," Monsoon Session: Opposition unites, likely to bring No Confidence Motion against Modi | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

Gandhi, who represents Patiala in Lok Sabha, again raised ripples by asking External Affairs Minister   to talk to her Pakistani counterpart on allowing Partition victims visit their birthplaces.  “The people of Punjab on both sides of the border suffered huge loss in terms of human lives during the partition of 1947 … and are still suffering from simmering wounds of partition and memories attached with it. “This is more true in case of the older generation on both sides of the border and thousands, if not lakhs in their late 70s or 80s have a strong yearning to visit their native birth places on both sides of the border,” Gandhi wrote to Swaraj.

Whenever Indians visit Pakistani Punjab, particularly Nankana Sahib, people on the other side gather to see if someone from their native village in India or a neighbouring village is a part of the visiting contingent, he said.  Even otherwise, relations between the people in both Punjabs have been cordial and warm. At every opportunity to host each other, they have made sure their guests return with warm memories, he pointed out.  This is only one of such issues taken up by Gandhi that strikes a chord with the people. Even on Punjab's burning problem of drugs, he has suggested radical solutionslike legalising and regulating the supply of traditional intoxicants such as opium and marijuana (cannabis).  He also sought an amendment to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, suggesting that non-synthetic drugs can be used to wean away addicts from the fatal synthetic drugs. He has urged the state government to allow plantation of marijuana and poppy husk in kitchen gardens on a trial basis on the lines of United States, Canada, Netherlands and Brazil. Gandhi has also been vociferous in seeking rights for Dalits, both inside and outside Parliament, holding the Brahminical order and capitalism responsible for their plight. He has been persistently attacking the principles laid in 'Manusmriti' while underlining that higher education for Dalits is the only way to their empowerment. In Punjab he has been running a campaign against establishment of separate cremation grounds for the Dalits. “In my constituency I have been able to convince more than 150 panchayats to do away with the practice of having separate cremation grounds for the Dalits,” he said. Gandhi has also been one of those rare politicians who have been speaking out against the Deras in Punjab whose heads have been exploiting the poor people by usurping their land and through other means. “It is my duty to speak for the people who are being suppressed by the Dera mafia. Why only Ram Rahim should be behind bars while others continue to cheat and exploit people,” he said. No politician in Punjab dares to utter a single word against the Deras being run by god men in the state for the simple reason of losing out on a vote bank. Gandhi has also been fighting for affordable health care to the masses. He has been seeking regulation of the private healthcare industry including the diagnostic laboratories. He has taken up these issues along with the need to bring medical devices under price control with Prime Minister  .  This is a considerable achievement for an MP who remains suspended by his parent party. Gandhi has refused to quit as an MP saying that he was elected by the people an no one else and he must take up their aspirations in his capacity as their elected representative. He is all set to part ways with   before the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls. He has floated a Punjab Manch hat is expected to evolve into a political party in due course in time. At present AAP in Punjab continue to be in turmoil and there are voices being raised to bring back Gandhi into the party fold along with another suspended MP Harinder Singh Khalsa. It remains to be seen how things unfold as polls approach but Gandhi has surely made a mark in his solo stint.",2018-07-18 18:28:00+05:30,, Why this suspended AAP MP continues to make waves | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

211,Catch Team,"The Concerned Citizens’ Group (CCG) undertook its fifth visit to Jammu and Kashmir from 19-23 June. During this visit, the group visited the Kashmir Valley. The aim was to assess the change in the ground situation, especially peoples’ sentiments, in the wake of revocation of the unilateral cease-fire (suspension of counter-insurgency operations) by the government during the holy month of Ramzan. However, two unforeseen developments circumscribed the visit – the assassination of a prominent journalist Shujaat Bukhari, editor-in-chief of the Rising Kashmir newspaper, and the fall of the alliance government of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) and the   (BJP) when the latter withdrew its support. In fact, when the CCG members boarded their flight to Srinagar from Delhi, Chief Minister   seemed fairly well-ensconced. By the time they alighted, she had been forced to tender her resignation. The group travelled to Late Shujaat Bukhari’s village Kreeri in Baramulla district to express condolences to his family members. The visit also coincided with the Kheer Bhawani festival celebrated by Kashmiri Pundits. The group also visited the Kheer Bhawani temple at Tulmul village in Ganderbal district to meet the Hindu minority of the state, especially Kashmiri Pundits, as well as devotees from other parts of India who visit the shrine during Jyeshtha Shukla Ashtami of the Hindu calendar. The Kheer Bhawani Mela took place on 20 June this year. The CCG held interactions in Srinagar with civil society representatives, journalists and political leaders, including the outgoing chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference President Omar Abdullah, Hurriyat leaders Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and Abdul Ghani Bhat. A meeting was also held with public intellectuals and social activists from Sopore, Handwara, Kupwara, Ganderbal and Kulgam who travelled to Srinagar to meet the group. However, the entire exercise was overshadowed by the political developments leading up to the imposition of Governor’s Rule in the state and the fear instilled in civil society in the wake of Shujaat Bukhari’s brutal murder. The CCG members included Yashwant Sinha (Former Finance and External Affairs Minister), Wajahat Habibullah (First Information Commissioner of India and former Chairman of National Commission for Minorities), Air Vice-Marshal (retired) Kapil Kak, Bharat Bhushan (journalist) and Sushobha Barve (executive director, Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation).Most Kashmiris believe that the manner in which the BJP masterminded the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti-led coalition government had little to do with the situation in the Valley.  They also tend to think that the PDP was taken by surprise by the timing of the development -- Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti was holding meetings in the State Secretariat, including one with the Centre’s Interlocutor Dineshwar Sharma on 19 June morning when her fate was being decided in Delhi. Had she known what was coming, they felt, she herself would have withdrawn support to pre-empt the BJP and gained political mileage.  The local perception is that the withdrawal of support was a part of a grand strategy of the BJP with an eye on the 2019 general election. The BJP perhaps felt that by going along with the PDP, an impression was gaining ground that the party favoured secessionists and her policies were more focused on the Kashmir Valley to the detriment of Jammu and Ladakh.  The common perception was that the   government had nothing much to show case in terms of its achievements for the 2019 general election, there were no new fault lines emerging in Indian polity which could be exploited electorally – hence the fall-back option of using Kashmir to communally polarise the electorate in the state as well as the rest of India.  The Kashmiris think that the harder the slap on their face, the better the electoral fallout in the rest of India. Most are reconciled, however, to the fact that they have been reduced to a pawn in the larger politics of the BJP. The perception of the opinion makers in Kashmir to the fall of the PDP-BJP alliance government invariably brought out the following common points: 1. There was a sense of relief in the people that the BJP-PDP alliance government had come to an end. Most believed that the alliance was doomed from the beginning as the two parties had diametrically opposite ideological and political perspectives. 2. The withdrawal of support had more to do with the BJP’s calculation of how it might be able to come back to power in Delhi in the next general election in 2019 and less with the developments in Kashmir. It was linked only marginally to J&K in as much as the BJP also needed to shore up its eroding voter base in Jammu. The party feared losing both the Parliamentary seats from the region in 2019. 3. The Jammu Hindus might not be swayed by blaming all the ills of the state on the PDP and its leader Mehbooba Mufti. In the last state assembly election even those Hindu voters who normally did not vote for the BJP, voted for it because they were upset with the corruption of the Congress ministers. Having voted for the BJP, however, they find that the performance of the BJP’s ministerial team was even worse. Whether fanning communal sentiment alone can turn them in favour of the BJP remains to be seen. 4. The performance of the BJP MLAs and ministers in the government was believed by many to be below par compared to their PDP counterparts. They seem to have had little guidance from senior BJP leaders and resentment against them was growing in Jammu. It suited the party to cover their lack of performance under a communal umbrella. 5. The security situation in the Valley was the same as it was three years ago – there was violence from both sides, there was no dialogue and the Agenda of Alliance agreed upon by the PDP and BJP had become meaningless. There was also no change in the intensity and extent of the anti-insurgency operations of the security forces. The Mehbooba Mufti government never came in the way of these operations. 6. There were no drastic developments on the ground which necessitated pulling the plug on the elected government. There were better opportunities for doing so using an increase in violence and militancy as an excuse in 2016 and 2017. Some believed that had the BJP-PDP government fallen in July 2016 protests after the death of a militant leader, Burhan Wani, then the level of radicalisation in South Kashmir might have been contained. 7. The claim that the situation in Kashmir was getting out of hand should have been an admission of failure of the both partners in the. However, the BJP converted that into an excuse for imposing Governor’s Rule in the state. It dubbed the PDP as a party that favours separatists and held it solely `responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the state. 8. To make use of the Kashmir developments in the rest of India, the BJP with the help of some mainstream television media had stereotyped all Kashmiris as “Islamic” militants/terrorists or terrorist supporters. This would not only allow the party to harden its position on internal security but also polarise the voters on communal lines. It was expected that this would be done not only in Jammu but also in the rest of the country. 9. The threat of Islamic militancy/terror in J&K was also likely to be used to rationalise a harder position on Pakistan. This might result in increased heating of the Line of Control and the International Border in the state as well as some other military adventures. 10. Both the threat of terrorism in the Valley and Pakistan’s hand in promoting it would be used in the BJP’s campaign for the general election of 2019. 11. The Union government led by the BJP would now take a more belligerent position on the validity of Article 35 A of the Indian Constitution which was currently being adjudicated by the Supreme Court and scheduled for a hearing in August. The BJP government in Delhi might also give up on the ambiguity it had to maintain on Article 370 because of the compulsions of its alliance with the PDP in J&K. The Ramzan cease-fire or suspension of counter-insurgency operations announced by the Central government was unilateral, sudden and without any discussion with either the militants, separatist leaders or Pakistan. Being unilateral, only one stakeholder i.e. the security forces was brought on board (albeit reluctantly). The cease-fire was announced without any preparation, had no roadmap and its objective was unclear except to convey that the security forces would not fire unless fired upon. The operations against militants continued during the month of Ramzan. In fact, more militants (24) were killed during 30-days of unilateral cease-fire than the previous one month. Apparently, the security grid in the state was unhappy with the unilateral cease-fire declaration by the Centre but had no choice but to go along with it. Most Kashmiris that the CCG met felt that there were two positive outcomes of the cease-fire – civilian killings and incidents of stone-pelting by protestors came down drastically as there were no offensive operations. And as a result youngsters did not get in retaliatory action by the security forces. The security forces did not move out unless they had specific information about the presence of militants. This created a positive feeling among the common people. Most people in the state expected the cease-fire to be extended at least till the end of the Amarnath Yatra in end-August. No one seemed to know what prompted the government to suddenly revoke the cease-fire. The speculation was that it might have been the constant stream of bad news from Kashmir as the unilateral cease-fire had no impact on the militants. Not only did militancy continue, the recruitment to the ranks of militants increased, an army man going on leave to join his family for Eid was kidnapped and murdered and a prominent journalist assassinated in broad daylight. Local opinion speculated that under these circumstances, the extension of the cease-fire might have come at a very high cost for the BJP in the rest of the country. Besides, it was thought that the sudden unilateral announcement of the cease-fire and its abrupt revocation gave the Centre a chance to claim that it gave the militants an opportunity for moving towards peace but they failed to grasp it. This would then provide justification for continuing its hard military strategy in the state. Governor’s Rule has been imposed in the state under Article 92 of the J&K Constitution. J&K is the only state of India in which Governor’s Rule can be imposed. In all other states President’s Rule is imposed under Article 356 of the Indian Constitution. The provision in the J&K Constitution is for only six months of Governor’s Rule after which either the state legislative Assembly needs to be revived or fresh elections held. However, Governor’s Rule can be followed by the Centre imposing President’s Rule which unlike in other parts of India, does not have to be ratified within six months by Parliament. In principle, President’s Rule in J&K can be extended indefinitely without parliamentary approval. The people of Kashmir did not seem to have high expectations from the new dispensation under Governor’s Rule. They thought that the Governor could now directly follow directions from Delhi without the mediation of an elected government. They also believed that the previous placatory language of need for a dialogue with all stakeholders would now be dropped and anti-militancy operations would continue in full swing. There were some who thought that the upside of Governor’s Rule was that the state administration would be free from political influence and the governance in the state would improve. The downside, however, was that without political representation disconnect would be created between the people and the administration and their access to it would decrease.  A major challenge for the new dispensation in Srinagar would be to ensure the safety of the Amarnath Yatra or pilgrimage, which began on 28 June and will last till August 26, Rakshabandhan. Security experts claimed that the threat perception for the Amarnath Yatra was more this year than the previous years. There was some local hope and belief that Kashmiri militants would not attack the pilgrims; that they had not done so in the past either and the real threat was from Pakistan-trained terrorists. Besides, an attack on the Amarnath Yatra would require the kind of planning of which the local militants were not capable.  However, a contrary view was that given the sense of alienation and disempowerment among the local youth who have taken up arms that they might do something desperate. In view of the security threats, the state government had designated a new route for the Amarnath Yatra bypassing those inhabited areas where there could have been a possibility of attack or stone-throwing. In the last three years there were only 18 incidents of stone-pelting at the Amarnath pilgrims. However, observers pointed out that given the sense of alienation and disempowerment among local youth and their changed mind-set, spontaneous and stray stoning of the pilgrims could not be ruled out. While organised stone-pelting could in-principle be controlled, it might not be easy to deal with spontaneous action. The next big challenge under Governor’s Rule would be to ensure that civilian casualties were minimised. People expect that the offensive of the security forces would intensify now, leading to more incidents of stone-pelting which could provoke retaliation and therefore more civilian damage. Many political observers suggested that the ‘right’ optics for BJP’s Mission 2019 might actually require that not only the militants but their ‘over ground supporters’ were also seen to be dealt with severely. The new Operation All Out was not being seen as a threat to the local militants but to the Pakistani terrorists. The local militants, it was pointed out, had little training hardly any weapons and no capability to initiate any dramatic attack. The state assembly has not been dissolved but put under suspended animation. This might give the Governor an opportunity to revive the political process when the circumstances permitted such a development. The life the J&K Assembly is up to December 2020. If the assembly is neither dissolved before that date then this would allow the various political parties in the legislative assembly to attempt to form a new government before the term of the assembly got over. This could happen through new alliances being formed -- with or without breaking the existing parties. Political observers in the state believed that the Governor might test the waters for elections by first trying to hold the Panchayat elections this October and only then make up his mind whether the state was ready for fresh assembly elections. The Panchayat elections were put off in February this year because of the prevailing security situation, as was the by-election for the Aanatnag Lok Sabha seat in April, 2017. Although there has been widespread condemnation of the daylight murder of Shujaat Bukhari, the unforeseen event has sent shivers down the spine of Kashmiri intellectuals and social activists. It is widely believed that the forces behind the murder did not want a resolution of the Kashmir issue through dialogue which left out certain stakeholders or which did not take their interests into account. The group elicited the views of people across a broad cross-section of Kashmiri society and came to the conclusion that the assassination had sent multiple messages to various constituencies in Kashmir: 1. It was a signal to civil society groups and social activists that their efforts towards reconciliation and peace would not be tolerated beyond a point; that they should not aspire to become a determining influence on the resolution of the Kashmir issue. 2. It was a message to all those who questioned not only violence by the state but also by the non-state actors -- militants and terrorist infiltrators form across the border -- that they needed to choose a side. 3. It was meant to frighten the media into not crossing the red lines drawn by the separatists and their backers. This might have a chilling effect not only on the local media but also on the representatives of the jingoistic and propagandist national media in the Valley. 4. The murder was also message to the Hurriyat leaders to keep to the straight and narrow – especially to those who had begun saying that they were willing to examine the offer of a dialogue by the Centre. It seemed that the civil society was in retreat in the Kashmir Valley after the murder as people feared the silencing of non-partisan voices. Even journalists seemed apprehensive of talking of peace. The only silver lining of this visit was the communal harmony the group witnessed at the Kheer Bhawani Mela with Kashmiri Pundits, Hindus from outside the state, Sikhs and even Muslims jostling with each other in the temple complex. Kashmiri Pundits who had come in 60 buses organised by the state government claimed that no one had thrown (s)tones at them or impeded their movement. They by and large talked of fraternal and friendly treatment along the way as well as once they reached Srinagar and Ganderbal. However, the overall political and security situation in the Kashmir Valley did not show any indication of improving. While the general public was shedding no tears after the collapse of the BJP-PDP alliance, it was also not enthused by the imposition of Governor’s Rule.  There was a sense of dejection and expectation of worse to come as the discourse on Kashmir seemed to be becoming more aggressive by the day. No one expected the Modi government to take a peace initiative. People were already looking beyond the next general election due in April-May 2019 and hoping for a change in Delhi’s policies after that. Until then the people believed that harsh security measures or “danda-raj” as they called it, was likely to continue as the dominant doctrine, irrespective of who implemented it. The change of guard in Srinagar would make no difference. The political space in the Valley has shrunk and along with it the prospect of a dialogue for peace has also become distant. The most disturbing aspect of the present situation was that the Kashmiri youth was under nobody’s control. Such was the sense of disempowerment and helplessness among the youngsters that not even parental control seemed to work on those intent on joining the ranks of militants. There was glamorisation of violence among them. The youth read about the lynching of members of the minority community in the rest of India and this probably further fuelled their antipathy towards the Indian state. The overall message that seemed to have gone around was that Delhi either did not recognise the Kashmir issue as political or that even if it did, it did not want to do anything about it. This perception might become very difficult for Indian democracy to deal with, even if there were a change of guard in Delhi in May 2019.",2018-07-02 17:18:00+05:30,, Whoever wins 2019 polls will have a tough job in Jammu and Kashmir | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

213,Anurag Dey,"In a massive victory for Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party ( ) over its power tussle with the Centre, the Supreme Court Wednesday unanimously held that the Lieutenant-Governor (LG) is an administrative head in limited sense; the real powers of governance of the National Capital Territory (NCT) lies with the elected representatives. In a verdict entailing huge political significance, a Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra stated that LG Anil Baijal cannot interfere in each and every decision of the  -led government. In three separate but concurring judgements, the Bench comprising Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan, held that the LG was bound by the “aid and advice” of the Council of Minister in all areas except land, police as well as law and order. “LG is an administrative head in the limited sense, and is not a Governor. He is bound by the aid and advise of the NCT Government in areas other than those exempted”, CJI Misra said, reading out the judgment.  The apex court verdict reversed the 2016 Delhi High Court judgment, which had held that the LG was the “administrative head” of Delhi and was “not bound by the aid and advise of the Delhi Council of Ministers”. Deliberating on the significance of ‘aid and advice', the bench said “if a well-deliberated legitimate decision of the Council of Ministers is not given effect to due to an attitude to differ on the part of the LG, then the concept of collective responsibility would stand negated”. “The difference of opinion between the LG and the Council of Ministers should have a sound rationale and there should not be exposition of the phenomenon of an obstructionist,” read the judgment. Observing that the LG must work harmoniously with the government, the court stressed that he cannot mechanically refer all matters to President without application of mind. It said though, all decisions of the Government have to be communicated to the LG, there is no need to obtain his concurrence in all matters. This does not mean that the Council of Ministers is bound by the LG. There is no space for anarchy and absolutism in our Constitution, the Bench said. “The Union and the State Governments must embrace a collaborative federal architecture by displaying harmonious co-existence and interdependence so as to avoid any possible constitutional discord,” the judgment said. “A conjoint reading of clauses (3) (a) and (4) of Article 239 AA divulges that the executive power of the Government of NCT of Delhi is co-extensive with the legislative power of the Delhi Legislative Assembly and, accordingly, the executive power of the Council of Ministers of Delhi spans over all subjects in the Concurrent List and all, but three excluded subjects, in the State List. “However, if the Parliament makes law in respect of certain subjects falling in the State List or the Concurrent List, the executive action of the State must conform to the law made by the Parliament,” the court elaborated. The CJI also specified that the NCT of Delhi does not have the status of a 'state'. The status of NCT of Delhi is sui generis, a class apart, and the status of the LG of Delhi is not that of a governor of a State, rather he remains an Administrator, in a limited sense, working with the designation of Lieutenant Governor, the court said. In his separate but concurring judgment, Justice Chandrachud held that the authority to take decisions lies with the elected government and said that a balance between the Delhi and the Central Governments was essential in view of the special status of Delhi. Justice Ashok Bhushan, in his separate but concurring judgment, said opinion of the elected government must be respected and concurrence of LG must be obtained in all matters.The key question in the matter was surrounding whether Delhi is a Union Territory, with the LG being its sole administrator, or is it a special state, with the LG bound by the aid and advice of the council of ministers? During the hearings, the Delhi government represented by P Chidambaram, Gopal Subhramanium and Indira Jaising, among others, argued that the LG as a titular head has superseding powers only in limited matters and cannot paralyse governance by delaying decision making. It also had contended that the LG was required to step in only in the case of an emergency. On the other hand, the Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh, argued that the Union has the supremacy so far as Delhi Legislative Assembly is concerned. He further argued that Delhi, being a Union territory, cannot be in the list of states under the Constitution and it would be undemocratic if the Legislative Assembly of Delhi has the same power as the Union of India. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been engaged in a bitter turf battle with Baijal and his predecessor Najeeb Jung, hailed the court verdict saying it was a big victory for democracy. Among the first to congratulate Kejriwal on the court verdict was former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha, who said the judgment was a victory for the people of Delhi, for democracy and for the Constitution.

218,Mandira Bhattacharya,"It is almost a hundred years since the discovery of the Indus Valley Civilisation by RD Banerji and others like MS Vats, D Ram Sahni and John Marshall, the then Director of Archaeology. But since then with continuing discoveries of newer sites, the inferences about the nature of the civilisation has changed over time. People continue to speculate about its origin, its spread, its uniqueness. Who were these people that built such complex urban centres? Did they speak a language that is similar to any group of the present day languages? Does the script have a following among the present day scripts? These continue to be much debated questions. The early assumption of the Indus sites being discontinuous with some being pre-Harappan and other being part of it, was changed to an understanding of a continuous civilisation which may be divided into Early, Mature and Late Harappan periods. This was arrived because of the linkages found in the different sites in different periods and thus the ' ' (the one who is created by oneself) character of the civilisation as was stated by early historians was settled. The Indus urban centres, after a full mature phase, show multiple symptoms of decay. The municipal system was falling apart. The drains were covering the roads. The planning had deteriorated into an asystematic affair. Trade too declined. The evidence from Sumer was no longer available.  In the last phase of the Indus civilisation, archaeologists have discovered new elements in the many artefacts excavated, and called this post-urban phase the Jhukar culture or the Cemetery H culture, which is distinct from the earlier phases of Indus civilisation.  It was a time of decay of the urban centres. The Indus people probably dispersed beyond. This dispersal took two lines of advance, one passing to the north of the Rajasthan desert and the other to the south. In the south, there were suggestions of several distinct waves of new settlements ( , BC Bridget and Raymond Allchin, 1968).  The imaginative idea that the Vedic people lived or created the Indus valley civilisation is difficult to establish, given that all historical evidence indicates that the Vedic people were mostly pastoralists. They did not know agriculture; even most of the terms in the Vedas used for cultivation are non-Sanskritic in origin, and are words of Dravidian and Munda origin.  The landscape of the Rig Vedic world was very different from the urban centres of the Indus Valley. Though both the early Vedic and the Indus Valley Civilisations were Bronze-centric, they cannot be said to be linked to each other based on this mere fact.The most recurrent question that is raised is on the issue of language and script. Did the language and the script of Indus Valley have any link with the Vedic people or the language spoken by them? Scholars of linguistics, of ancient languages, archaeo-linguistics, and of course archaeologists continued hair-splitting discussions on its antiquity and legacy.  Some over-enthusiastic nationalists such as Tilak ( , Bal Gangadhar Tilak, 1903, Pune) tried to identify it as belonging to the Vedic Aryans and asserted that the Aryans had migrated to India. But the discovery of the Harappan sites by Marshall led him to the most plausible origin and linking it with the Dravidian speaking Brahuis living in and around West Pakistan. A Dravidian origin of the script has been the most agreed upon formula by scholars like Asko Parpola, Iravatham Mahadevan and many others. But to arrive at a conclusive inference, we still await the discovery of a Rosetta stone with the Indus script. The Vedas came from the   (what is heard) and   (memory) tradition, an oral tradition strictly preserved within a group of people -- the Brahmanas. The early Vedic people did not practice writing, which is a necessary condition for a civilisation to be called urban. Writing, as such, appeared much later in India with the Buddhist king Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. The Vedas were put in writing even much later in the 15th century. Where did the Aryans live or where did they come from is a question that has been much debated. The moment a similarity was established between the European and the Vedic languages, history took many interesting turns. Gordon Childe in 1926 published his book,  , which was used by the Nazis to argue about purity of race and justifying the holocaust on the basis of it and making it difficult for Childe to even mention it. This did not dissuade the scholarly world. The hypotheses that all the Indo-European languages were spoken in a restricted area, somewhere in the Eurasian Steppes or somewhere in Caucasus has not yet been resolved with any amount of certainty. Not much archaeological evidence in favour of the Rig Vedic people is available. The excavation at Hastinapur in 1950-52 by BB Lal had established the stratigraphy with Ochre Coloured Pottery (OCP) at the bottom followed by the Painted Grey Ware (PGW) and finally the Northern Black Polished Ware. This established the fact that each layer indicated a settlement of a different group of Indo-Aryan people coming to this region at different points of time with different levels of technological expertise. The last has been connected with the advent of iron in the sub-continent. The date of the use of iron has been fixed to the 1000 BCE. The migration of the Indo-Europeans to the Indian sub-continent was not a single event. They came in batches over a period of time. Archaeological evidence of the OCP and the copper horde associated cultures -- the PGW people in the fertile plains of the Doab, Gandhara grave cultures from modern day Swat, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the north, along with the Cemetery H culture from Harappa, were probably the settlements of the early Indo-European immigrants. Since 1822, hordes of copper implements have been discovered from the Ganga-Yamuna valley. Most of these were chance discoveries. In the early 1950s, several sites in the Ganga-Yamuna valley yielded copper objects of similar nature. They were discovered along with pottery, now called OCP (Allchins,  , 1968, page 200). Many of these hordes contained the Anthropomorphic figure and the Antennae Sword. But the latest discovery of the three 'chariots' along with a copper horde by the ASI at Sinauli village of Baghpat district in Uttar Pradesh has not been reported earlier. The date according to the excavators (2000-1800 BCE) coincides with the dispersal theory. This find at Rakhigarhi seems to have ignited the sort of 'Diseased nationalism' as famously pointed out by Grahame Clark while condemning the use of archaeology in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy (Archaeology and Society, 1939) among a certain section of the political class today. Rewriting history is central to a nationalist project. Eric Hobsbawm rightly pointed out that “History is to Nationalism, what poppy is to an opium addict!” The conclusion drawn by some and promoted by others that this find establishes that ‘Aryans’ were inhabitants of the urban Indus civilisation, is seriously far-fetched. The DNA report of the skeletons discovered at this site needs to be carefully examined to arrive at any conclusive inference. A find such as this does not alone change the archaeological map created by years of toil and sacrifice. Rakhigarhi is a huge site, it has been only partially excavated. The reports have to be scientifically validated to shift dramatically from the existing theories. But till then, we who rely on rationality and scientific evidence, shall stand by the historically established theory of Bronze Age horse-tamers, with chariots arriving in the subcontinent continuously for a period, probably from Iran; probably with links to the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex located in present-day northern Afghanistan, eastern Turkmenistan, southern Uzbekistan and western Tajikistan, centred on the upper Amu Darya — but surely in the decaying years of the Harappan civilization.",2018-07-06 17:36:00+05:30,," Chariots and ancient DNA are fine, but history of India has to be about rationality | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

220,Sudarshana Chakraborty,"Taking a day off is not easy for Aloka Naiya, Sabita Sau, Sabitri Mistri and many doemstic workers like them – entire households go off gear without them. So, in a way it was a big deal when they took leave to attend a rally. On 16 June, on International Domestic Workers' Day, more then 2,000 such workers hit the streets of Kolkata to celebrate the West Bengal government's recognition to Paschimbanga Griha Paricharika Samity (PGPS) as a trade union. That's a first for the state which has a history of trade union movements. Those gathered expressed their enthusiasm with slogans like ' ' (Can't do without us) and ' ' (We, the gang of girls united / Would now bring about change). Curious onlookers collected leaflets as they watched the rally.  “The recognition will make us stronger, help us get better pay and make our job secure,” Naiya said.The domestic workers’ rights movement brings together three different movements – the women’s right movement, social security movement and the unorganised sector workers’ movement. PGPS is among several such organisations of domestic workers in West Bengal under the umbrella of Griha Shramik Adhikar Abhiyan. The domestic workers placed 13 demands to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the state labour minister as well as some lawmakers so that those can be discussed at the Monsoon Session of the State Assembly. The demands include: The domestic workers of the city have two more demands: the constitution of a domestic workers’ welfare board and a creche for their children. “A few of us from the organisation regularly met government officials since 2014,” Tahmina Begum, a PGPS member, said. “We submitted all information and papers they sought and have now achieved this 'trade union' status. It will be good if other organisations try. That will increase our strength.” she added. PGPS has members from seven districts: North and South 24 Paraganas, Kolkata, Howrah, Asansol, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling. The recognition of PGPS as Trade Union is a step forward to the recognition of domestic workers as labourers in Bengal. States like Bihar, Jharkhand, Odhisa, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and Rajasthan already have laws fixing minimum wages for domestic workers; Kerala, Maharastra and TamilNadu have welfare boards for them; India has more than 25 lakh domestic workers, 57 per cent of them are women, according to data from the National Sample Survey (2009-10). The country does not follow regulations framed by International Labour Organization for domestic workers. This workforce is not included in social security schemes. The Centre drafted a policy, but it is yet to be legislated.  “We are happy about PGPS becoming a trade union. Now we have to push for a welfare board, a minimum wage of Rs 54 per hour and a comprehensive legislation for domestic workers,” Anibrata Pramanik, an activist involved with Griha Shramik Adhikar Abhiyan, said. A domestic worker pointed out that being recognised as a union equals to being recognised as workers and help in bargaining collectively with employers. At a day-to-day level, she hoped she and her colleagues would no longer need to have her tea in broken tumblers, no more be fed stale and leftover food, not be accused of theft or humiliated otherwise, not have to face misbehaviour by employers, and would be able to work in an atmosphere free from sexual abuse. “Our biggest demand is the minimum wage, which we are yet to achieve in our state. Also a welfare board is necessary for the wholesome development of our community. In our State Committee meeting we have discussed issues like – why it is humiliating to submit our identity cards at police station before getting a job and how to deal with the issue, written contracts, creches for our children etc. We hope, now we’ll be working towards these issues in a more focused manner,” added Mishtri, who has been working as a domestic worker since her adolescent days. Now she works in a single household and her employers are encouraging about her activism. Most employers were supportive of the move, Tahmina said. Pointing out that there were various types of employers, Tapashi Moira, former secretary of PGPS, said: “Those who were good to us will remain so.” Many present at the rally said their employers knew about their activism and did not dissuade them. There were doubting Thomases too. “One employer told me that going to the rally would be pointless as we would achieve nothing. I told her to keep watching TV. I could finish my work and still participate. After all, I am fighting for my right,” a worker said. PGPS and other organisations are now concentrating to broaden the spectrum, visiting new areas and engaging with more workers. Workers are now seeking written contracts with employers. Senior trade unions leaders welcomed the move cautiously: “This is good news. Domestic workers form an important section of the unorganised sector. Their demands regarding minimum wage, welfare board, and leaves must be met and they should be treated as labourers,” Tapan Sen, general secretary of CITU in West Bengal, said. “Now that they are getting the status of a trade union, they should work in collaboration with other unions,” he added. “I welcome the decision. But we have to keep in mind that achieving the status does not mean misusing the power and disturbing the social structure. Domestic workers have to keep in mind that this status comes with a responsibility,” Pradip Bhattacharya, a member of the National Committee of INTUC, said. He sought the formation of a commission to look into the demands raised by domestic workers and their rights and place them before the government. “Rights of unorganised sector workers and their movement have to be dealt with cautiously,” he added. Chandrarekha Pandey, co-ordinator of domestic workers at All-India Unorganised Workers Congress, said: “This is an achievement. It will give domestic workers the status of laborers. I don’t think it’ll have any negative effect on their relation with employers as it will be more transparent now.” “This status of trade union will make our organisation stronger, but this is only a first step. We have not achieved all. Our employers are not one but many,” PGPS Secretary Anita Mishtri said. The domestic workers and activists pointed out that they were aware of their responsibilities and that being a Trade Union will help them to fight any irregularity if there is any among themselves too. In India there is no legal framework as of now regarding the rights of domestic workers. In this scenario as PGPS is granted the status of a Trade Union this definitely marks a sign of change in the rights movement of the unorganised sector workers.",2018-07-05 18:41:00+05:30,, Domestic workers of West Bengal find new hope in trade union | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

224,Rajeev Khanna,"It has been six months that the Congress got a drubbing at the hands of the   (BJP) in the hill state of Himachal Pradesh. Just when the things have started warming up for the Lok Sabha elections due next year, Congress leaders in the state seem to have taken no lesson from their humiliating defeat as they continue bickering instead of making efforts to put their act together. This phenomenon was on a grand display when the newly appointed All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge Rajni Patil came calling for her first visit to the state. Former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and his loyalists decided to stay away from the first meeting addressed by Patil on 11 June. The writing was clear on the wall for Patil: Managing the state Congress is not going to be an easy task, particularly when there are just a few months left for the Lok Sabha polls and the stakes are very high. She called on former state party chief Vidya Stokes at her residence. This was followed by a meeting with Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) office bearers, inclusing current state chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu and former chief Kaul Singh Thakur. Those absent included Virbhadra, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Mukesh Agnihotri, AICC secretary Asha Kumari, Rajinder Rana and Vinay Kumar. Even Virbhadra’s son Vikramaditya did not attend the meeting: He was reportedly away in Sikkim along another first-time legislator Ashish Butail. On Tuesday Patil was compelled to admit before the media that factionalism is rife in the Grand Old Party and the party leaders need to put their egos aside and come together for a good performance in the Lok Sabha polls. She expressed hope that the differences between the leaders would be sorted out and they would come on a common platform to come up with a winning performance in 2019 polls. Virbhadra reportedly continues to be miffed over Sukhu continuing as the state president of the party and wants the reins to be handed over to one of his loyalists. Observers feel that he is back to his blackmailing ways. Sources within the party say that although a change of guard in the organisation is imminent but it remains to be seen when the party high command decides to appoint a new president for the state. The high command is busy preparing for the electoral battles in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan besides trying to stitch an alliance for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. But a party insider said: “The sooner Congress president appoints a new organisational leadership in the state, the better. The bickering is sending out a bad message to the electorate.” Sources said there are many contenders for the party president's post. Prominent among them are Asha Kumari, Rohit Thakur and Ram Lal, all winners in the recent Assembly polls, along with heavyweight Kaul Singh who lost. According to party members, Asha Kumari was the first choice for the Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader but she had to pay the price for her fracas with a woman police constable on the day   was reviewing the poll results in Shimla. She remains a top contender for the state president's post, given her stature in the party and her contribution towards the party winning the Assembly elections in Punjab, where she was the party in-charge. Observers however feel that the party high command would be reluctant to appoint a Virbhadra loyalist to the post as it has already appointed Mukesh Agnihotri as CLP leader. He is seen to be close to the former CM and now the high command would want to do a balancing act. There is a view that the party needs to appoint someone from the Mandi-Kullu region, a Congress bastion lost in the 2017 polls. The party scored a big zero in Mandi district which sends 10 MLAs in the house of 68 members. It had lost its most powerful leader in this district in Sukh Ram just ahead of the polls as he moved to the BJP camp. With Jai Ram Thakur becoming the BJP chief minister, the power centre has moved to Mandi district as he represents the Seraj seat. Earlier the power centres were in Shimla, Kangra and Hamirpur districts. Many believe that the Congress should appoint a president from the new power centre. Party insiders also point out that this is the right time to develop a second-rung leadership among the youth in the party. Many believe that the young leaders have to be brought to the forefront. This has happened in the BJP, albeit accidentally, with Jai Ram becoming the chief minister. “Virbhadra did not allow a second rung leadership to develop. Since 2012 he was heard saying that this would be his last political battle but he is nursing his political ambitions even today. On one side he wants to lead the party in yet another battle and on the other Sukhu wants his tenure to extend as much as it can while banking on the support from the central leadership,” said Congress functionary. Meanwhile, continuing with his pressure tactics to get Sukhu removed, Virbhadra is reportedly planning a show of strength in Kangra on June 16. He has called a meeting of the Congress leaders including present and former MLAs that will be attended by the CLP leader Agnihotri. Kangra is the district that sends maximum number of 15 MLAs to the state assembly. The party could win just three seats of Palampur, Kangra and Fatehpur in the recent polls. Virbhadra intends to tour the district before the meeting. The move is seen as a major attempt to isolate Sukhu. “The party high command needs to streamline the Congress functioning as soon as possible if it wants a good result in the Lok Sabha polls. Till now the party cadres and supporters were demoralised as the BJP was getting walk overs in most of the state polls but the recent wins in by-polls and Karnataka have rejuvenated the worker who now needs proper leadership,” said a Congress functionary. Will the high command intervene to set the house in order or will it allow the 'Congress culture' prevail ?

227,Charu Kartikeya,"Much has been made of the absence of some of the stalwarts of Indian politics from Congress President  's iftar. At least four top leaders who had attended HD Kumaraswamy's swearing-in as chief minister of Karnataka to present a picture of Opposition unity – Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar,   and   – did not attend. However, does that necessarily mean a boycott? As has already been reported, none of the parties that these leaders head went unrepresented at the iftar. Dinesh Trivedi, DP Tripathi and Satish Chandra Mishra were there on behalf of Banerjee, Pawar and Mayawati, respectively. Even Yadav had sent an emissary, a source who attended the iftar told Catch, but it is yet to emerge clearly who this representative was. Mayawati is in any case known to stay away from functions hosted by other parties. Barring Yadav, the presence of confidantes of the other leaders amounts to an unequivocal expression of solidarity with the  . The absence of the satraps themselves could be attributed to various factors. A senior Opposition leader who attended the iftar, told Catch on the condition of anonymity that he did not get that feeling at the iftar which the next-morning newspapers tried to portray. He said the general atmosphere at the gathering was of bonhomie and in the spirit of collaboration. The source also underlined that the presence of other senior leaders of the parties concerned should be enough to scotch misgivings about any kind of rift. He did add, though, that when a rainbow coalition is in the making, the various players should be allowed to have bargaining chips of their own to balance their own interests with that of the alliance. Another senior leader of the Opposition unequivocally said that media was mischievously playing up the absence of some leaders. He said this was a social gathering and did not necessarily demand the same level of attendance that a political gathering like Kumarasamy's swearing-in demanded. He added that all those leaders who were invited and were in Delhi attended the iftar. Many have conjectured that by staying away from the event, Pawar, Banerjee, Mayawati and Yadav did send one message to the Congress, though – Rahul Gandhi is junior in experience to all of them and so it would be hard for them to signal that he shall be the leader of a multi-party alliance that is still in the works. This is borne out by the fact that they have all attended gatherings hosted by former Congress president   in the past. Gandhi and Mayawati even shared a warm hug and held hands as recently at Kumaraswamy's swearing-in. With about a year to go for the Lok Sabha polls in 2019, there is a long journey ahead for the Opposition. Key issues like seat-sharing and alliance leadership are yet to be thrashed out and events like the swearing-in and the iftar are just the beginning. As the new Congress chief, this was Rahul's first such function. Events will pick up pace when the country will start inching closer to polls. Until then, developments like some leaders not attending a few events should not be over-analysed.",2018-06-14 23:33:00+05:30,, Absence of big-wigs from Rahul Gandhi's iftar doesn't mean chink in opposition unity | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

229,Charu Kartikeya,"It has been quite a spectacle to see Congress spokespersons bickering with a senior journalist on social media over the latter's advice for their party to back Delhi Chief Minister  . He is on a sit-in at the office cum residence of Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal. He is demanding that LG should order Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers in the Delhi government to end their strike and resume their work. The Delhi CM's demand has found widespread support among top leaders of the Opposition as well as the   (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Apart from four CMs who visited Kejriwal's residence (Mamata Banerjee, HD Kumaraswamy, Chandrababu Naidu and Pinarayi Vijayan) and expressed their support for his struggle, many others have backed the   chief. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary  , Rashtriya   (RJD) leader  , rebel BJP leaders Yashwant Sinha and Shatrughan Sinha and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Working President MK Stalin have also expressed support. Support was also forthcoming from  , a BJP ally, former diplomat KC Singh and former Union Health Secretary K Sujatha Rao. The Congress party continues to steadfastly refuse to be a part of this long list and is slamming Kejriwal day after day. Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi has asserted that her party “isn't obligated to support AAP” and that democracy gives her party the “right to choose who & what to support”. She's right on that count but what she has cleverly tried to hide in that repartee that it is not Congress's obligation but priority that is being questioned in this debate. It is important to filter through the theatrics to clearly see what is at play here. For over three years now, the AAP-led government in Delhi has suffered at the hands of a malicious campaign run by the BJP-led Union government. The LG vs CM standoff, being discussed right now because of Kejriwal's dharna, is only one facet of this multi-pronged campaign. The complete set of instruments to perpetually trouble AAP and its government have included: At the foundation of the present impasse is allegation by Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash that AAP MLAs assaulted him at CM's residence in the latter's presence. Prakash made the allegation nearly four months ago, leading Delhi Police to promptly lodge a case and initiate a probe.  In an unprecedented spectacle, a posse of policemen even raided the CM's residence to, ostensibly, seize CCTV footage. For all their diligence, police are yet to even file charge-sheet in the case, let alone prove conclusively that the assault did take place. However, this has not deterred IAS officers posted in the Delhi government's various departments from stopping work in protest, demonstrating blind faith in Prakash's allegation. By their own admission, since February, they have been consistently refusing to attend several meeting called by AAP ministers. They say they do not feel safe attending these meetings. In any other state or in a Union government department, such a conduct by any bureaucrat would have attracted initiation of disciplinary action. Bureaucrats are Constitutionally bound to serve elected governments, but not in Delhi. Prime Minister  , otherwise, sings paeans to co-operative federalism but does not believe that this engineered paralysis in Delhi is an assault on the spirit of federalism. What is an embattled chief minister to do, in such a situation? The Congress party is afraid of AAP and it has its reasons. AAP was born out of a movement that was essentially anti-Congress. When the movement transformed into a party and also came to power, it didn't just send the Congress out of power in Delhi, it reduced the Congress to zero in the state assembly. Voter groups that had been die-hard Congress supporters for decades abandoned the party and adopted AAP overnight. It is this fear that is generating the Congress's inability to see that in not supporting AAP even amid this turmoil, it is essentially supporting the BJP's excesses. How will this approach enable the Congress to seek public support in its own fight against the BJP? Party after party and leader after leader in the Opposition camp has demonstrated on multiple occasions now that the presence of AAP in their ranks is not only desirable but necessary. However, the Congress has consistently resisted this nudge, with even   and now   refusing to invite AAP for Opposition gatherings hosted by them. For a united Opposition to take on BJP effectively in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the Congress' hostility towards AAP will have to end. However, any indication of that happening anytime soon is not in sight.",2018-06-18 19:27:00+05:30,, Why Congress's steadfast refusal to back AAP is a damaging manouvre | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

232,Anurag Dey,"In a dramatic move the   (BJP) Tuesday pulled out of the  -led Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) government, pushing the state towards Governor’s rule. Blaming alliance partner Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for its inability to handle the deteriorating security scenario in the state, the BJP said it had become “untenable” for it to continue with the alliance formed in 2015. The pullout followed BJP President  ’s meeting with National Security Advisor   and all BJP ministers in the Jammu and Kashmir government. Announcing the pullout in the national capital, BJP General Secretary Ram Madhav held the PDP entirely responsible for the breaking of the alliance and said the decision was unanimous and taken after due consolation with Prime Minister   and party chief Shah. “We discussed the situation in (J&K) at different levels, with the home ministry, with agencies after taking necessary inputs. After consulting the Prime Minister and Amit Shah, we have decided that it is not possible for the BJP to continue with the alliance. It has become untenable for the BJP to continue the alliance government in J&K,” Madhav told the media. Madhav said the PDP was unsuccessful in restoring peace in the Valley and encouraging fast paced development in Jammu and Ladakh regions – the twin agenda with which the BJP-PDP alliance was formed. “In the last three years, the BJP as part of the government performed its function well but that cannot be said for the other side. “The condition that is prevailing is worrisome. Terrorism and violence in the valley has increased, there is rapid radicalisation and the fundamental rights of the citizens are in danger. We have all seen how veteran journalist Shujaat Bhukhari was killed in broad daylight. His chilling murder is an evidence of the situation prevailing there,” he said.  While praising the Modi-led Union government for assisting the state government in every possible way, the BJP said the Mehbooba-led PDP was “not successful” in handling the situation which eventually triggered the BJP’s pull out. “They (PDP) were not fully successful in handling the situation. We don’t question their determination but the reality is that the state government was unsuccessful in discharging its responsibility of improving the situation particularly in the Kashmir Valley,” Madhav said.  He accused the PDP of discriminating the Jammu and Ladakh regions in terms of development work. “In Jammu and Ladakh, our ministers had to face hindrances in ushering in development. All the ministry that we had, we tried to do our best but we are not alone in the government. The people of Jammu and Ladakh feel they are being discriminated,” he claimed. Claiming the pull out decision was in taken for the sake of the country’s integrity and security, the BJP recommended the governor’s rule in the state. “Keeping in view the country's security and sovereignty and keeping in mind that J&K is an integral part of India, its time the reins of power in the state be handed to the governor and the bring the situation under control,” Madhav said. He also said the suspension of the armed operations in the Kashmir Valley during Ramzan failed to evoke any response either from the terrorists or separatists. “We had taken the initiative of ceasefire during Ramzan and expected this will attract a better response from terrorists and separatists. Suspension of operation wasnot a compulsion for us, it was taken from a position of strength but it failed to attract response from them. That is why the home ministry has decided to not to continue with the ceasefire,” he said.  He also defended the decision to enter the unlikely alliance with the PDP in 2014.  “The only possible result that time was governor’s president’s rule if we had not formed the alliance. It was fractured mandate but at the same time it was duty to honour the people’s mandate,” he said adding that the pull out decision was not guided by any fear of losing ground to the PDP.",2018-06-19 16:25:00+05:30,, End of road: BJP pulls out of Mehbooba-led govt in Jammu and Kashmir | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
233,Riyaz Wani,"When the People's Democratic Party (PDP) –   (BJP) government was formed in 2015, it began with a due sense of trepidation about its political and ideological fallout for the state. The coalition’s single-most redeeming feature was the promise it held of the economic recovery of the state and the hope of a political process towards resolution of the Kashmir issue.  The expectation was not unfounded. The Agenda of Alliance forged by the two parties contained development and political commitments to the effect. But a few months into its term political and ideological confrontations between the partners took centrestage, almost hobbling the government. It didn’t make any headway with even the then urgent rehabilitation of the flood victims, taking as long as 15 months to fulfil.

This was deemed to be the prerogative of the PDP only which had enabled a Hindu nationalist party to rule India’s only Muslim majority state for the first time in the past 70 years.  So, the BJP move is certain to have left PDP in an embarrassing position. The party had gone against its long-standing ideological position in Kashmir and the nature of its electoral mandate to ally with the BJP. It stuck to the alliance even through five-month-long unrest in 2016 when a New Delhi backed hard-line response to the protests left around 100 people killed and several hundred completely or partially blinded. For Mehbooba, the loss will be greater. The alliance has left her political reputation in tatters.  A reputation she had built brick by brick. At one time she successfully incarnated as a leader who was a relatively more credible mainstream political proponent of a shade of Kashmiri nationalism willing to settle for a respectable political deal within the Indian Constitution. But, in power, Mehbooba burnt herself out far sooner than even her predecessor Omar Abdullah. And now with the BJP leaving her in the lurch, she hasn’t been left a place to hide.Though there was little that was visible on the outside, tense disagreements over the handling of the worsening situation in the state marked the coalition over the past one-and-a-half month. It began with the Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti’s call for a unilateral ceasefire in the Valley, which the state BJP initially said it didn’t support but later centre went ahead and announced the halt in operations against militants during holy month of Ramzan. And it ended with the killing of journalist Shujaat Bukhari, which apparently proved a last straw. The state BJP has revealed these differences in a detailed statement shortly after the party  withdrew its support. “Insistence of the PDP for extension of ceasefire and a soft approach towards militants, Pakistan and separatists was only hurting the nationalistic sentiments, not only in Jammu and Kashmir but in the whole of the country,” BJP spokesman Sunil Sethi said.  “PDP had underestimated the resolve of Bhartiya Janata Party in thinking that the PDP will have its way in all matters. The door has been rightly shown to it and all forces inimical to national interest that there is strong resolve of nation to stay together and to be ready for any sacrifice for the unity and integrity of the country.” The party has also revealed its future plan of action in the state: “Now is the time of an all-out war with militants and their supporters and they will not find a place to hide and run. It was highly unfortunate that our partner was always trying to tie our hands from taking strong measures against enemies of the nation. “Expecting that a mighty India will bow down to have dialogues with separatists or Pakistan and its armed stooges is indicative that it (PDP) was living in a fool's paradise.” Both the National Conference and the Congress have refused to extend support to the PDP.  “The National Conference has neither been approached by any party nor would they offer their support to any party,” NC Vice-President Omar Abdullah told reporters after meeting Governor NN Vohra. Omar supported Governor’s rule in the state and said he had assured Governor of his party’s support. Omar also batted for early elections. Similarly state Congress president Ghulam Ahmad Mir termed the alliance PDP-BJP alliance unholy. ""It was expected to break from day one. They had betrayed the people of the state and supporters of the respective parties. They sought votes on opposing agendas,"" Mir said. Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad has already ruled out support to the PDP. The NC has 15 seats and Congress 12 in the J&K Assembly.",2018-06-19 18:05:00+05:30,, Mehbooba CM no more: A doomed coalition all along | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

235,Sulagna Sengupta," President  's much-touted Sampark for Samarthan got a jolt when party leader Rahul Sinha received a snub from veteran actor, playwright and poet Soumitra Chatterjee. When Sinha, who has led the party in West Bengal in the past, visited Satyajit Ray's favourite actor to present him with a booklet of the  -led government's “achievements”, Chatterjee gave him a piece of his mind. Demonetisation, he said, was a harassment for the common people. Under Shah's guidance, BJP leaders have started visiting celebrities and intellectuals to seek support, with General Elections less than a year away. Chatterjee used the opportunity to speak his mind. “Demonetisation wasn't practical. I am not aware about its long-term effects as I am not an economists. But the move caused hardships for the people, who had to change large amounts at one go,” he told Sinha.  Demonetization was a sudden attempt and taken without proper precautions, leading to disruptions in normal life for quite a few months, said the actor who has been known for his Left leanings. Unlike many of his colleagues, he never switched sides to back the ruling Trinamool Congress. He, though, has maintained cordial relations with the government and has been present at a few programmes attended by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, including the 2017 Kolkata Book Fair. After meeting the actor at his residence, Sinha however said: “He was pleased with the overall development that Modi government has undertaken in the last four years.”",2018-06-16 17:44:00+05:30,, BJP's Sampark for Samarthan gets a snub from thespian Soumitra Chatterjee | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

238,Charu Kartikeya,"While announcing their pull-out from the government in Jammu and Kashmir,   (BJP) leaders attributed their decision to three reasons: the rise of “terrorism, violence and radicalisation” in Kashmir Valley; “danger” to “fundamental rights of the citizens” and lack of developmental work in all three regions of the state. More surprising than the sudden withdrawal is the reasons that the party has given. The state of affairs in J&K today are certainly much worse than they were in 2014, before the PDP-BJP alliance took charge. Ceasefire violations have gone up manifold, militancy has only risen, security forces have suffered massive casualties and unrest among the general population has spiked. After jointly presiding over this downturn for more than half a term, how can BJP suddenly distance itself from it? If   was the Chief Minister, BJP had a deputy chief minister. If PDP had 14 ministers in the 25-member Cabinet, BJP had nine. The blame for the worsened crisis in the state can not be for the PDP to bear alone. The lack-of-development theory that the BJP is trying to sell also flies in the face of what the party has been trying to portray ever since it came to power at the Centre. None other than Prime Minister   himself has made it a point to visit J&K every six-eight months. On each occasion, he has also made it a point to either lay the foundation of a development project or inaugurate one. These ribbon-cutting events have been spread across all the three regions – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. In July 2014, Modi inaugurated the 240 megawatt Uri-II hydropower project, near the Line of Control. During the same visit, he also inaugurated a train to Vaishno Devi from Jammu's Katra. In August 2014, he visited Ladakh to lay the foundation stone of the 330-km Leh-Srinagar transmission line and also inaugurate two hydro-power projects in the region. In November 2015, he announced Rs 80,000 crore package for the state in Srinagar, inaugurated 450 MW Baglihar Hydro Electric Project Stage-II and laid the foundation stone of four-laning of Udhampur-Ramban and Ramban-Banihal section of National Highway 44. In April 2017, Modi inaugurated the Chenani-Nashri tunnel on the Jammu-Srinagar highway. In November 2017, the Union New and Renewable Energy Ministry also announced that a 1.5-mw small hydropower plant had been commissioned in in Biaras Drass of Kargil under the Prime Minister’s Ladakh Renewable Energy Initiative. Most recently, Modi visited the state last month to inaugurate as many as seven projects. These included the 330 mw Kishanganga Hydropower Station in Kashmir's Bandipore, launching of work on the Zojila Tunnel to connect Srinagar, Kargil and Leh, laying the foundation stone of the Srinagar Ring Road, the Pakul Dul Power Project in Jammu's Kishtwar, Jammu Ring Road and also the inauguration of the Tarakote Marg and the Siar Dabri-Bhawan material ropeway at the Vaishno Devi shrine. If PDP was not moving in tandem with the BJP, also in power at the Centre, how were these range of inaugurations happening? The pull-out from the government appears to have been motivated by some other concern. As of now, what this concern is is not clear but the reasons given by BJP are a smokescreen. Adding fuel to these speculations is the PDP's response to the withdrawal. She sent her resignation to the Governor and spoke to the press later. While admitting that she was taken by surprise, neither her words nor demeanor conveyed a sense of hurt or peeve. She also didn't portray the BJP's move as a betrayal. Kashmir is a dark theatre and it is often not known what is going on behind the scenes. One can only hope that the fall of the state government is not the harbinger of something more sinister.",2018-06-19 19:12:00+05:30,, Why BJP's reasons to defend J&K pull-out don't add up | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
239,Atul Chandra,"The Jewar greenfield airport project in Uttar Pradesh seems headed for turbulence. Farmers whose land in Gautam Buddh Nagar was marked for the airport alleged that the   (BJP) government is shortchanging them. To fast-track land acquisition, the Adityanath government on 28 May signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA), Greater Noida and Noida. The airport was expected to be completed in 2022. For the first phase 1,500 hectares, is needed, for which six villages have been identified. Farmers were irked because just before the signing of the MoU, the government changed the land use of two villages from rural to urban. The two villages, Dayanatpur and Randhera, accounted for 900 ha, more than half of what is needed. Changing the land use status would reduce the compensation their owners would be eligible for. Compensation was pegged at four times the circle rate for rural land but only double the circle rate for urban land. Circle rate is the price of land fixed by the administration. It varies from one area of a district to another, depending on their deemed importance. Feeling duped by the government, farmers of all six villages have threatened to do a Bhatta Parsaul. Agitating farmers there had clashed violently with the administration over land acquisition during  's regime, leading to four deaths. At present, upset farmers held protest meetings from 28 May to June 2 and said they would not accept compensation. About 500-600 farmers from every village reportedly attended the meetings daily. While the district administration is said to have forwarded the farmers’ viewpoint to the state government, Dhirendra Singh, the BJP MLA from Jewar, said that he too apprised Adityanath of the simmering anger. As the social impact assessment was still on in these villages, he was hopeful his government won’t let the farmers down. Singh said the started 18 May, when the state government issued a notification imposing Section 12A of UP Industrial Act on 16 villages of Jewar, ending Panchayati Raj and declaring them urban. The timing of the land use change was unfair as farmers would get reduced compensation, he added. Farmers were paid four-times the circle rate for the land acquired for Eastern Peripheral Expressway, inaugurated by Prime Minister   a day before bye-elections to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency. The area in contention is part of the same district, and Singh said he was finding it difficult to convince farmers to agree to the land use change at the start of the acquisition process. Singh, on the pillion of whose bike   rode to Bhatta Parsaul after the 2011 violence, found the situation especially embarrassing. He feared the project could be shifted to either Haryana or Rajasthan if the farmers decided not to yield. But why did the government decide to underpay farmers? One report said that the government did not have the Rs 4,000 crore it needed to pay in compensation. According to government sources, a total 3000 ha was required for the project, out of which 1,441 ha was needed for the initial phase. Denying a shortage of funds, a sources said the state’s civil aviation department would contribute Rs 1,500 crore from its budgetary allocation and the Noida Authority would match that. The Greater Noida Authority and YEIDA are to fund Rs 500 crore each.",2018-06-22 17:56:00+05:30,, UP Farmers suspect Adityanath govt wants to underpay them for Jewar airport land | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

241,Rajeev Khanna,"The continuous stream of atrocities on Dalits coming to limelight is fast turning into the ruling   (BJP)-led Gujarat government's shame. After Gujarat is marketed as a model state by Prime Minister   and BJP National President  . One recalls the time when after Modi's ascent from Gujarat chief minister to Indian prime minister was followed by teams of bureaucrats from Delhi and subsequently from others states that the BJP won to go and study the much promoted 'Gujarat Model'.  The question that continues to rankle the minds of ordinary rational citizens is that why is it that Dalits in Gujarat have to ride a horse in their marriage procession under police protection ? Why is it that they are thrashed for using the suffix 'Sinh' to their name ? Why are they assaulted for for wearing a 'Mojdi' (a pointed footwear associated with royalty)? Why are they targeted for supporting a moustache? Why are they beaten up for watching an upper caste Garba ?  These are issues that go far beyond the routine debate on the issue of job reservation. One does not have to go far into the remote interiors to come across such instances. They galore right under the nose of the state government in districts of Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad and Mehsana.  After a video going viral on 14 June of a youth from Valmiki community being beaten up brutally for being well dressed and claiming to be from the upper caste Darbar community has followed the instance of a Dalit riding a horse back under police protection for his marriage ceremony. According to reports the police have booked 10 people from upper castes for threatening Prashant Solanki for riding a horse for his wedding procession at a village in Gandhinagar district on Sunday. Prashant had reportedly arrived by car at Parsa village of of Mansa taluka and was scheduled to cover the last mile to the wedding venue on a horseback in accordance with the prevalent tradition. However, before he arrived, some upper caste persons spotted a youth waiting with a decorated horse. When they came to know that the decorated horse was meant for the wedding procession of a Dalit they threatened the boy making him flee in panic. Reports say that later, the village sarpanch arranged another horse for the Dalit youth but the celebratory mood had changed as the procession now went under police protection, following threats from people coming from upper castes. Besides the ceremonies got delayed by as many as four hours. It is common knowledge in villages where feudal mindset continues to prevail that a large number of influential Darbars still believe in being above others in social hierarchy considering themselves to be royal descendants. The idea of well-dressed Dalits riding horses and sporting moustaches is still not palatable to a large number of them. Hence, resent the idea of Dalits sporting heavy moustache, dressing well and riding horses during wedding processions. “It is not that there has been a sudden splurge in atrocities. The thing that has changed is that these instances are now getting highlighted instantly in the form of videos and reports going viral on social media. Earlier these instances were suppressed at the village level itself. There was no media reportage and hence no reaction from the government. The emphasis was on striking a compromise at the village level,” points out a Dalit and Right to Information (RTI) activist based at Gandhinagar. He added that at the same time despite registration of cases, the matter gets diluted in courts and quite often the accused get bail easily. “There have been occasions that the accused have come out on bail only to threaten the victim once again. An interesting aspect of the phenomenon is that at present the Dalit MLAs from the ruling party are in a corner. On one side the BJP leadership is pressuring them to contain the Dalit anger and on the other the community is accusing them of failing to take up the cause of the community,” he added. “The matter of concern here is that there is no effective political leadership among the Dalits. They have been elected on reserved seats with the support of the  , Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal activists to fill in the blanks. “They just act as stamp pads of the Hindutva organizations who set the political agenda for them. It is a matter of research why they come out with political narrative on religion and not caste after they are elected,” points out Maulik Shrimali, a Dalit activist from Nadiad. He says that despite the political reservation, Dalits are never treated as an ally in governance and there is no effective participation from them in the ruling dispensation. The Dalits are particularly peeved over the political leadership in the government keeping mum on the increasing number of atrocities coming to light. “Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja has not come out with any statement on this issue. Perhaps he does not want to say anything against his own Darbar community which is his core voter base. “The government has instead been fielding police and administrative officials to address the agitated Dalits. Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has not bothered to visit the family of any of the victims of the caste atrocities,” pointed the Dalit activist based in Gandhinagar. “We have been hearing of Rupani convening emergency meetings to address the plight of cows and lions but he has shown no emergency when it comes to the continuing assault on Dalits. We do not oppose his concern for cows, but he should have some sensitivity towards Dalits also who are human beings,” Shrimali said. “The growing number of instances coming to light also show the hollowness of the ruling class. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a statement saying that kill me but not my Dalit brothers but he has been unable to stop the atrocities even in his home district of Mehsana,” he added. The Dalits account for just seven per cent of the voting population in Gujarat and are further helpless on account of being widely scattered. But instances of atrocities on them send across a strong message against the BJP in other states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where their presence is considerable. The BJP cannot afford such instances coming to light regularly in the poll year. The RSS through its frontal organisations like Samajik Samrasta Manch and Sewa Bharti is trying to send the message of inclusion to the Dalits. These organizations recently honoured the students from Scheduled Castes who had cleared the central and state administrative services exams where the speakers propagated the ideals of cultural nationalism. How the BJP contains the political fall out of cases of atrocities hitting headlines however remains to be seen.",2018-06-20 19:11:00+05:30,, Why Dalit atrocities in Gujarat coming to limelight is becoming BJP's shame  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

243,Akash Bisht,"Former Union minister Saifuddin Soz's upcoming book on   added to the ongoing political turmoil around Jammu and Kashmir. The   has attacked the veteran Congressman for being against 'national interest'. But then that is only to be expected from a party whose hardline stance on the state has been among its foundational blocks. The 'mainstream' media – especially its electronic avatar – also took its cue (not surprising really) and hounded the leader from Kashmir throughout the day. But what was more surprising than their hunger for TRP was the way the Grand Old Party of Indian politics buckled under pressure.  Not only did the   distanced itself from Soz's comment, but also pledged disciplinary action against the party. But for what? Did they find time to read what Soz wrote? Repeating, more or less, what he wrote, Soz told news agency ANI Friday morning: “(Pervez) Musharraf said Kashmiris don't want to merge with Pakistan; their first choice is independence. The statement was true then and remains true now. I say the same but I know that it is not possible.” The Congress and the media seems to have simply obliterated Soz's stress on “it is not possible”. The party high command does not seem to have sought a clarification from Soz or go through the contents of his book. Even more unfortunate, the Congress went to the extent of calling it a gimmick to drive sales. “We completely reject Soz’s statement. It’s a political gimmick to sell his book. Our J&K unit will take appropriate action against him,” party spokesperson RS Surjewala. For that matter, none of these going overboard in criticising Soz seems to have made any efforts to acquaint themselves with the contents of the volume. While the book is yet to be officially released, Catch has access to its contents, based on which it clearly offers glimpses of Kashmir's history. Starting from prehistoric times, it traces the journey of the region. Towards the end he talks about the peace process envisaged by Musharraf, and India's former prime ministers AB Vajpayee and  . He writes that Musharraf convinced the Pakistani brass, within and outside the Army, that the peace formula was the only possible solution that would not yield a situation on ground as a defeat for one party and victory for the other. “He had also convinced his colleagues that the resolutions of the UN on Kashmir had constituted a redundant situation as these meant a tight-jacket for Kashmiris whether they wanted to go with India or to Pakistan. Musharraf had explained that if Kashmiris were given a chance to exercise their free will, they would prefer to be independent. In fact, this assessment of Musharraf seems to be correct even today!” The Musharraf-Vajpayee-Manmohan formula included present borders but free movement across the region; autonomy on both sides and demilitarisation. It is a known fact that the root of all ills in Kashmir emanates from the strong feeling among its population of being independent from both India and Pakistan. In that context, what Soz said reflects the popular sentiment of the people of the state. If the media and Congress had gone through the content of the book, they would have realised how critical Soz is of the   (RSS) and how it has made no efforts to be a part of the solution. “It is an unfortunate situation that the RSS ideology and narrative on Kashmir has always created a problem and this organization has never tried to be a part of the solution. Recently, it has added a serious dimension to the already tense situation of unrest in Kashmir by approaching the Supreme Court for the revocation of Article 35A of the Constitution of India. It is the same article that protects various rights of people of the state,” Soz writes. Ironically, the BJP has made an issue of Soz's statements but has remained tight-lipped on multiple controversial and communal statements by its leaders. Whether it is the creation of a 'Hindu Rasthra' or sending minorities to Pakistan or taking away voting rights from Muslims, the saffron party has, in fact, shielded those making such statements. As far as the Congress is concerned, it should not let the media dictate how it responds to such situations. If it initiates disciplinary action against Soz, that can further alienate the party in the state, which is going through one of its most troubled times in the recent past. In the end, it would be about a book that talks about Herodotus' reference to Kashmir, Fa Hien's travels, Marco Polo's views, George Forster's account of its and several such accounts. Overall, the 248-page book offers great insights into the history of province and should not be solely judged on one statement and the unnecessary controversy surrounding it.",2018-06-22 22:55:00+05:30,, Problem isn't with Soz.

255,Ashwin Aghor,"The Bhima-Koregaon case took a strange twist Wednesday when Maharashtra Police arrested five prominent activists under the much-panned Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, alleging they were “Naxalites”. This drew sharp criticism from Dalit leaders and the civil society. The Pune Police arrested Dalit activist Sudhir Dhawale from Mumbai. Activists Shoma Sen, Mahesh Raut, and lawyer Surendra Gadling were arrested from Nagpur while Rona Wilson was picked up from Delhi. They arrests were for alleged hate speeches and distributing “controversial” pamphlets. Offences were registered against some of these activists, including Dhawale, in January itself after the violence broke out at the turn of the year in Bhima-Koregaon. It was alleged that their inflammatory speeches at Elgar Parishad. The Elgar Parishad was organised by Dalit activists and intellectuals on 31 December last near Shaniwarwada in Pune. “We have been working on gathering evidence to make a strong case,” a senior police officer said from Pune. The police claims are sure to be hotly contested though.Dalit acivist and a member of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly Jignesh Mevani called the arrests an “attack on Ambedkarite movement”.  The People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) condemned the arrests of (those) “who have been active in various movements and organisations, and have publicly defended the rights of Dalits and various sections of marginalised people.” Mihir Desai, on behalf of the civil rights organisation, said: “The simultaneous arrests at different places in the country, by state authorities, smack of predetermined planned attack on people who have been protesting against injustice and atrocities perpetuated by various state and non-state Hindu right-wing groups.” He called the arrests a “blatant violation of citizen’s rights to freedom of expression and voicing dissent... a move to target individuals working for rights of the marginalised sections of society, and to produce a chilling effect on voices of dissent.” Veteran poet Sambhaji Bhagat said: “All those arrested are highly sensitive about human rights and have been working for it since many years now.” The battle of Bhima-Koregaon, fought on 1 January 1818, gained prominence after BR Ambedkar visited its site on the anniversary day in 1927. An obelisk there, listing the names of Dalit soldiers of the British East India company who fell in battle fighting Peshwa forces, has ever since become a symbol of solidarity. Dalits have thronged the site on New Year's Days since then to mark Ambedkar's visit. This New Year's Day was the 200th anniversary of the battle and thousands gathered at the Pune village on 31 December-1 January to commemorate the the Mahar regiment's achievement. However, things soon took a violent turn, with incidents of arson and stone-pelting being reported from Bhima-Koregaon and adjoining villages. One person died and several were injured. There was an ensuing Dalit backlash and Maharashtra bandh on 3 January. The impact was felt up to Maharashtra's capital Mumbai as well. An first information report was lodged on a complaint by Tushar Damgude at Pune's Vishrambaug police station against Dhavale, Sagar Gorkhe, Harshali Potdar, Ramesh Gaychor, Deepak Dengle and Jyoti Jagtap. Sections 153 (provocations for riot), 505 1B (causing fear, inducing violence), 117 (abetment) and 34 (criminal act by several persons) of the Indian Penal Code were used. The Pune Police also filed an FIR against Mevani “an inflammatory speech” at Elgar Parishad. Dhawale is the state president of a co-ordination committee formed for the Parishad. The Devendra Fadnavis government earlier appointed a two-member committee to probe the violence. Activists of troubadour group Kabir Kala Manch were booked and organisers and speakers at Elgar Parishad were accused of delivering provocative speech. The cops also filed FIRs on complaints by Dalit activists against Hindutva activists Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote for “inciting violence”. Ekbote was arrested, but is out on bail.  PUCL's Desai pointed out that the duo faced several complaints and FIRs. “These two pro-Hindutva leaders have a history of allegations for causing communal and caste tensions, rioting.” They allegedly desecrated the memorial of a Dalit icon in Pune on 29 December, 2017, he said. “The Supreme Court even denied anticipatory bail to Ekbote,” his statement added. “Both have deep links with the   and are clearly being protected by the ruling dispensation,” he alleged. On the ground, while Bhide and Ekbote roam free, Dalit activists now bear the brunt. Those arrested today have even been termed “Naxalites” – the Indian government establishment's umbrella term for those from the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). According to Desai, this has become a standard protocol. According to him, under the garb of countering “Naxalites”, democratic protests are labeled unlawful, protestors are incarcerated for years and subsequently released when the State fails to prove its case. ""The whole purpose is to crush any protest against injustice, deny people their basic citizenship rights, deprive them of their basic means of livelihood,” he said. Citing the example of Wednesday he said a prejudicial narrative that those arrested are “Maoist sympathisers” or “top Maoist operatives” was underway in mainstream media. “The current situation in the state and country can only be termed as an unannounced emergency. The government has unleashed atrocities against those who don't approve of its ideology,” Bhagat said. “It did not even touch Bhide, who openly applauded Manu Smriti. On the contrary, innocent people are being harassed,” he added. “Oppression of the innocent, claiming they are Naxals will only alienate them … It is high time that the Opposition and Dalit parties like BRP Bahujan Mahasangh came together and took a firm stand against it,” he said. According to Republican Panther President Sumedh Jadhav: “The government is after Dalit activists ever since Elgar Parishad. Dhavale and Prakash Ambedkar successfully exposed the government. The Parishad infused enthusiasm among Dalits and now the government wants to keep dedicated, hard-working activists under pressure until the next elections.”",2018-06-06 20:18:00+05:30,," Activists slam Fadnavis govt, cops after arrest of Dhawale and others for Bhima-Koregaon violence | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

263,Atul Chandra,"Prime Minister  ’s most telling photograph that comes to mind is from 2011 when he refused to wear a skull cap offered by a cleric in Gujarat. It was inconceivable then that one day mosque visits would form an essential part of Modi’s itinerary during his tour to Muslim nations. In Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Oman and more recently Indonesia and Singapore, he visited famous mosques and even agreed to wear a green religious chador without a fuss. These were either diplomatic compulsions or meant to tell Muslims in India that he was not averse to accepting them. Muslims were more amused than convinced with the apparent transformation in the PM as he is yet to visit any mosque in India and his party persists with its policy of dividing the society on communal lines and prepares accordingly for the 2019 elections. Modi is now scheduled to visit Maghar, the place of nirvana of 15th century mystic poet Kabir, in the Sant Kabir Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh on June 28 to lay the foundation stone of Sant Kabir Academy. Unlike the   (BJP) and its leaders who advocate religious divide, Kabir was a secularist extraordinaire who preached through his verses that Ram and Rahim reside in one’s heart and was against muezzin’s daily call to worshippers or noisy invocations to God in temples. Such was Kabir’s appeal across religions that Maghar has a temple built by his Hindu disciples while his Muslim followers have a mazar in his name. With Guru Granth Sahib also having Kabir’s verses, a local gurudwara conveys the saint poet’s message. According to a senior BJP leader, the PM was visiting Maghar to spread Kabir’s message of oneness. That may not be entirely true. The PM’s aim would be to win over weavers, who are Muslims, and Other Backward Classes (OBC) who form a bulk of Kabir’s followers. The move seems to have been necessitated after setbacks in Noorpur and Kairana bye-elections in which OBCs are said to have deserted the party. With the   and the Bahujan Samaj Party joining hands, the BJP is trying to revive its social engineering formula to neutralise the political combo. While the PM’s Maghar visit will be keenly watched, the state government led by  , who bluntly said he does not believe in celebrating Eid, is subtly pressing ahead with his religious agenda. At its meeting held a couple of days back the state Cabinet decided to ban sale and consumption of alcohol in five areas in Mathura – Barsana, Radha Kund, Gokul, Nandgaon and Baldev.  Chief Minister Adityanath also called pro-temple seers, who are upset with the Modi government for not keeping its promise of building a Ram temple, for talks. Those called include Mahant Nrityagopal Das and Mahant Suresh Das, who has warned that the BJP would be defeated in elections if the temple was not built. Meanwhile, the state government is pulling all stops to make Dev Deepawali at Ayodhya, Holi in Vrindavan and Kumbh at Allahabad international events. Work on Navya (new) Ayodhya and a 108-metre tall statue of Ram along the Saryu River are in progress. A Pravasi Diwas (NRI Day) is scheduled to be held in Varanasi in the last week of January 2019 when Lok Sabha elections would be close at hand. While talking development with them, the government plans to take foreign diplomats for a holy dip in the Sangam. Talk on progress will clearly have a religious overtone. Likely renaming of Allahabad as Prayagraj before Kumbh will be the highlight of that approach. Vijay Bahadur Pathak, the BJP’s state general secretary, sees nothing wrong in the government’s actions. “We are sworn to cultural nationalism and we will not conceal our faith. We will showcase whatever has been done in Varanasi, Ayodhya, Mathura and at Kumbh as Shiva, Ram and Krishna are symbols of our cultural identity.”",2018-06-08 18:28:00+05:30,, Modi's mosque run: Will it help | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

266,Charu Kartikeya,"The   (BJP) Saturday got a bitter dose of its own medicine plus an additionally bitter shot with the fall of its two-day-old government in Karnataka. BS Yeddyurappa's resignation even before the floor test is likely to be remembered as one of the most embarrassing moments in the party's history. If previous developments in Goa and Manipur had established BJP chief   as the master of electoral intrigue, the imbroglio in Karnataka has snatched away that credential from him.  Not only has the BJP been forced to sit out of power in spite of emerging as the single-largest party, its state as well as central leadership has been left red-faced. The party brazenly deployed all underhand tricks a democratic power-play has room for and yet failed miserably. In the process, it also ended up sullying the high Constitutional office of the Governor and the humbling process of government formation itself. The spectacle of Congress MLAs rumoured to have been 'poached' trooping into the Assembly and voting for the JD(S)-Congress alliance was a sight to behold.The day began with the Supreme Court rejecting the Congress party's appeal to remove KG Bopaiah as the pro-tem speaker. However, the apex court allowed the floor test to be telecast live, in order to ensure full transparency. Then emerged rumours of BJP having succeeded in poaching at least 2-3 Congress MLAs. Congress accused mining barons Reddy brothers of having kidnapped these MLAs at a hotel. Since the Supreme Court had ordered the DGP to ensure the protection of all MLAs before the trust vote, he personally went to the hotel later to check on these remours. Minutes later, these very MLAs appeared in the Assembly, with Congress' Vokkaliga strongman DK Shivakumar in tow. The implication was clear – if any attempt had indeed been made to poach them, it had failed. The BJP's failure to cobble up the numbers it was boasting about became clear within minutes, as Yeddyurappa started presenting what seemed like a farewell speech in the Assembly. His addressed was interspersed with several bursts of crying, as he tried to convince that the only objective behind all the manoeuvrings he and his party indulged in was to serve the farmers of the state. Promising to serve the people of the state in power or in the Opposition, Yeddyurappa announced his resignation from the CM's position, even before facing the floor test. Commentators were quick to recall former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's similar resignation in the Lok Sabha in 1996 that he too was forced to tender before facing the floor test. The major difference, however, behind the two situations is that Vajpayee, in his speech, had steadfastly refused to resort to the manipulations that the BJP carried out in Karnataka. The BJP's failure to form the government in Karnataka will come as a big boost for the morale of Congress workers across the country. Getting used to seeing their party lose to an ever-expanding BJP even where the latter did not have the numbers, Congress workers will now be able to hope that with the right strategy, their party can still win elections. The Congress's hard-fought victory was the result of a successful three-pronged strategy. While senior leaders of the party lost no time in reaching out to JD(S) for a post-poll alliance on the latter's terms, its legal team snatched power from the BJP's jaws, getting the SC to curtail the 15-day window given by the Governor to the BJP to just one. The third part of the strategy, and the most crucial one, was to do everything possible to keep its flock intact. With strongmen like Shivakumar watching over and with critical help from the ruling TRS in Hyderabad, where all Congress MLAs were sent for a day, the Congress succeeded remarkably in this task. The roller-coaster developments in Karnataka have given two indications. First is that the Congress is finding its mojo back. The party made a quick move for an unconditional post-poll alliance, that woo with a rival, even after not getting the numbers. In the process, it learned the importance of allowing strong regional parties to take the lead. The Congress then launched and saw to the end a successful legal battle, not allowing any move by the BJP to go unchallenged. Both these strategies showed that four years after facing decimation at hands of the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress party is regaining the stomach for a fight. More crucial, however, was the first display of opposition unity in the anti-BJP camp after the Bihar elections of 2015. A number of opposition leaders had critical roles to play in the entire saga.   chief   not just got her lone MLA in the state to support the Congress-JD(S) combine, she also spoke to JD(S) chief H D Devegowda to urge him to make the alliance happen. Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee also spoke to the former PM to make the same appeal. CPI(M) also expressed support, with Congress thinking about packing off its MLAs to a resort in Kochi at one point of time. Neighbouring CMs Chandrababu Naidu and K Chandrashekhar Rao also extended support to this campaign, promising to provide protection to the Congress flock in their respective states. If this sentiment can be further worked upon, a Grand Alliance to give the BJP a run for its money in 2019 could be easier to stitch-up than previously thought. From that perspective, the floor-test saga in Karnataka could become a watershed moment.",2018-05-19 20:58:00+05:30,, Why the fall of Yeddyurappa's 2-day govt means much more than just loss of face for BJP | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
267,Riyaz Wani,"Just when we expected the campaign for Central Bureau of India (CBI) probe into the Kathua rape and murder to fizzle out after the Supreme Court ruled it out, the demand for it has only gotten stronger in Jammu. Ousted   (BJP) minister Lal Singh’s continuing public rallies in support for it have seen crowd growing. The latest rally on Sunday drew an estimated 25,000 people. The rally christened ‘Dogra Swabhiman Rally' (rally for Dogra self-esteem) started at Lakhanpur, bordering Punjab and went to Londi Morh Kootah. A large number of protesters, including Singh walked the 36-kilometre stretch. Others accompanied on buses, cars and bikes. In his address to a charged-up crowd Singh made a case for a CBI probe by framing argument in terms of quest for the justice for the eight-year-old victim, calling her “a daughter of Dogras”. At the same time he played to the local sentiment and made the issue a larger battle for restoring the “dignity and honour” of Dogras. “This rally is an answer to all those who labelled the Dogras of Jammu as pro-rapist, hate-mongers and communal people with bigoted mindset and accused us of creating hurdles in delivering justice,” Singh said and the crowd nodded in approval. “Dogras are facing the worst-ever onslaught on their dignity and honour. We have to launch a decisive battle,” he added. The campaign has come a long way since Singh launched it soon after resigning as the state forest minister last month. He and former industries and commerce minister Chander Prakash Ganga were ousted from the Cabinet for participating in a rally of the Hindu Ekta Manch in support of the accused. Now it is less about the CBI probe and more about reconfiguring the political landscape in Jammu in the run-up to the next year’s General Election, to be followed by state Assembly polls in 2020. What has also changed is its bitterly polarising nature. Singh has tried to avert it by recruiting some Jammu Muslims and pitting them against Kashmiri Muslims. “Gone are the days when the Kashmir-centric parties could gag our voice through oppressive means. Now Dogras have decided to fight,” 59-year-old Singh said. “We don’t want any lessons on secularism and brotherhood from Kashmir-centric parties, which lack guts to speak against fundamentalists. Since times immemorial Dogras have accommodated people of all religion and regions.” There were slogans against Kashmiri parties. Singh’s brother Rajinder even called Chief Minister   a “dog”. What was not lost on political observers is that Singh could draw massive crowds in Kathua and Sambha districts. This has worried the BJP, which is looking to improve upon its electoral tally in Jammu. The party won 25 of the 37 seats in the province. BJP leaders from the area – Assembly Speaker Nirmal Singh and newly inducted ministers Rajiv Jasrotia and Devendra Kumar Manyal – are fast losing confidence of their voters. Tempers run so high that earlier this month protesters stoned the cavalcade of another BJP minister Sham Lal Choudhary's on the Jammu-Pathankot highway. The disaffection could only further spread in the province, with a growing number of thepeople certain about the false implication of the accused by a Crime Branch team which though headed by a Hindu has Muslim investigators as its members. And should the campaign crystallise into an anti-BJP mood and rebel Singh succeed in harvesting it for his personal political glory, it could signal deeper trouble for the BJP. In the rest of the country outrage against the rape and murder was more or less uniform. So, the BJP didn’t feel the need to acquiesce in to the demand for a CBI probe. In Jammu, it still has time to conrol the situation. Besides, Singh remains a BJP leader and will be a challenge only once he quits. The party has adopted the line that while it is not against the CBI probe, it can do little after the Supreme Court ruled it out. But the danger inherent in Singh’s campaign, despite his belated secularisation bid, is its possible communal turn – if not against Jammu Muslims then certainly against their Kashmiri counterparts. And should that happen, its political fallout will not remain limited to the state.",2018-05-21 18:56:00+05:30,, Lal Singh's mega rally: Long political shadow of Kathua rape and murder | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
268,Rajeev Khanna,"Dalit unrest has been fueled once again with yet another alleged killing of a youth from the community on the periphery of Rajkot city in Gujarat's Saurashtra region. The 'Gujarat Model' of governance that has been played up across the country by Prime Minister   and his close associate  , the national president of   (BJP), stands shamed again. Agitated Dalits are blaming the insensitive attitude of the state's BJP government for the frequent recurrence of heinous atrocities against them. Dalit leader and legislator Jignesh Mevani tweeted a disturbing video of victim Mukesh Vaniya being thrashed with a rod:The Saurashtra region has emerged as the eye of atrocities against Dalit though many, including local journalists, dispute this. Surendranagar district in the region is among those referred to as one of the most atrocity-prone districts. Vaniya too was a resident of the district's Parmala village. Vaniya, a rag picker, was beaten to death Sunday at a factory in Rajkot's Shapar Veraval industrial area, sources said. When he along with his wife and a female relative went looking for scrap they were apprehended on charges of theft by the owner of the fatory and some workers, a source alleged. While Vaniya was mercilessly beaten up with sticks and belts, the two women managed to escape and went looking for help, screaming all the way. When they returned they found him writhing in pain, crying for help. When they took him to a hospital, it declared him dead, sources said. The police allegedly took their time making arrests, waiting for the deceased's post-mortem report. Things started moving only when video grabs from closed-circuit television cameras went viral. Eventually, the owner of the automobile parts factory and four others were arrested and charged with murder and various sections under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. “He went to Rajkot with his wife looking for livelihood only a few days ago. The family members cremated him at his village Monday after an assurance from the Rajkot Collector for due monetary compensation and five acres of land. If the administration dithers, therer would be a massive agitation,” said Nattubhai Parmar, a Dalit activist from Surendranagar, who attended the cremation. The question that has emerged: why is there no decline in atrocities against Dalits in Gujarat in general and Saurashtra in particular? “The insensitivity of the government fails to curtail atrocities. Perpetrators have got the message that they can get away with anything. Action is taken only after extreme incidents like flogging or killing,” Parmar said. A major grudge Dalits have is that cases of atrocities are diluted or perverted by the police and administration. They remain be peeved at the government for failing to make the report of the probe panel on the 2012 Thangadh killings public despite adverse observations by the Gujarat High Court. People still remember the public flogging in Una (2016) of Dalits for carrying out their vocation of skinning cattle carcass. In several other instances Dalits have been targeted for issues like sporting a mustache or twirling them in from of those from upper castes, attending garba, riding motorbikes by upper-caste houses, ritual riding of horses during weddings and for using surnames like 'Singh'. They are often denied hair cuts by village barber shops, served in separate utensils at tea stalls, made to sit separately for mid-day meals in schools, denied entry into temples and denied water from common wells. Accounting for only seven per cent of the state's population and widely scattered, Dalits in Gujarat are one of the most vulnerable – marginaliSed socially as well as politically. In March, a Dalit was allegedly hacked for buying and riding a horse at a village in Bhavnagar district. Dalits opposed the police letting off upper-caste 'Darbars' accused by the victim's father. They instead arrested a marginal farmer from other backward classes a month and a half down the line, saying that he killed the deceased for teasing his wife. The latest instance once again elaborates the ground for Dalit unrest over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act across the country.",2018-05-21 17:42:00+05:30,, Gujarat Model shamed: Yet another Dalit killed in Rajkot | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

272,Neeraj Thakur,"Fuel price politics is an effective tool for the Opposition in Indian democracy. Prime Minister   used it effectively to mobilise people during his campaign for the 2014 General Election against the   government. Thousands of hoardings across cities screamed 'Bahot hui, petrol/diesel ki maar, abki baar Modi sarkar' (You have had enough of fuel price tyranny, this time vote Modi). On assuming power he was lucky and the international crude oil prices crashed to an 11-year-low of $27 a barrel. This helped his government collect more in excise duty as well as reduce retail prices of petrol and diesel. After making a windfall gain of more than Rs 4 lakh crore in revenue, through higher excise duty of petroleum products, the government seems to have run out of luck. The price of Brent crude has touched $78 for a barrel, pushing the price of petrol to Rs 84.40 in Mumbai on Monday (21 May). The rise has turned the tables and made Modi government a target of the Opposition. The question is, can the government do anything to control fuel prices? Yes, It can. Currently, more than half the price of petrol at the pumps comprise taxes, duties and dealers' commission. For diesel, it's over 40%. Since 2014 the Modi government has made a lumpsum selling oil. Nothing stops it from cutting taxes now. It must be remembered that crude prices haven't really touched their highest ever, which means they can rise further. While the government gained handsomely through high duties, it has not been able to use to improve its fiscal situation. The demonetisation of Rs 1,000, and Rs 500 notes gave a jolt to the economy, increasing administrative costs due to the publishing of new notes. According to the Reserve Bank of India, the government spent Rs 21,000 crore in printing new notes. All it could manage was to extinguish its liability, on only Rs 16,000 crore worth of old notes, as they were not deposited back in the system. The fiscal position of the government was further hit by the haphazard implementation of the Goods and Services Tax, which generated lower-than-expected revenue. The tight fiscal position was exposed despite several denials in the last Budget, when Finance Minister   announced a 3.5% fiscal deficit against the targeted 3.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Due to lower revenue generation and higher expenses, the government had to borrow Rs 50,000 crore more in the final quarter of the last financial year. The government also revised its deficit target for this financial year to 3.3% of GDP from 3%. The Modi government has been denying pressure to reduce fuel taxes, but some are expected to keep in mind the upcoming elections to three state Assemblies as well as to the Lok Sabha in 2019. If that does happen, the government will have to redo its fiscal math to accommodate loss in revenue from excise duty. Historically, government's do not mind breaching fiscal target in the last year of their term.

275,Joyjeet Das,"Three days before   completes four years in office, a large section of political parties opposed to him presented a colourful show of strength in Bengaluru Wednesday. The occasion: the swearing-in of HD Kumaraswamy as the chief minister of Karnataka.  It was a short affair: the   (Secular) leader was quickly administered the oath of office as was state Congress chief G Parameshwara (as Kumaraswamy's deputy) by Governor Vajubhai Vala, preceded and followed by the National Anthem.The cheers of the green-and-white flag-waving JD(D) supporters collected on the lawns of the Vidhana Soudha – Karnataka's legislative seat that the BJP so desperately wanted to dominate – spilled over up to the High Court premises across the road. The brevity of the occasion was outdone by those cheers as it was by the bonhomie on display on the stage by a veritable who-is-who of Indian politics: Bahujan Samaj Party supremo   in a trademark neutral suit, beaming, was one of the first to enter the frame. She was seated next to new-found ally in Uttar Pradesh,   President  . From the other side entered West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in her usual white cotton sari, walking with a purpose up to Kumaraswamy. Sharad Yadav, who has only recently launched the Loktantrik Janta Dal, walked over to greet her. The CM-designate walked in with his family. His father and party patriarch, former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, walked up to the front stage and bowed to the crowd in front. The last time his son took this oath – 12 years ago, supported by the BJP – he had distanced himself, keeping his anti-BJP credentials intact. There was Nara Chandrababu Naidu, the CM of Andhra Pradesh, a part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, up to only recently. From Maharashtra, Nationalist Congress Party leader Sharad Pawar, a veteran of many political fights, attended. From the Left there were Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary  , his Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan and CPI National Secretay D Raja. Staunch Congress ally Rashtriya Janata Dal was represented by party chief  's son Tejashwi. He might have been the youngest among the guests but was among the most vocal supporters of Kumaraswamy being made the CM when Governor Vajubhai Vala overlooked him for BS Yeddyurappa from parent BJP. There was also western UP strongman Ajit Singh of the  . Congress President Rahul Gandhi walked in with his mother and United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi and outgoing CM Siddaramaiah. Tamil Nadu Opposition Leader MK Stalin of the Dravida Munnetra Khazagam, could not attend as he went to Thoothukudi after Tuesday's police firing killed 11 anti-Sterlite protestors. Telangana CM K Chandrasekhara Rao and Delhi CM   had met Kumaraswamy earlier. Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik skipped the event citing planned engagements. But Wednesday was about those present on the stage and the possibilities they can create. Usual bickering was replaced by smiles, hugs and holding hands. Sonia's show of warmth to the senior leaders, especially to Mayawati and Banerjee was not missed by the cameras. Ditto for the affection that seniors bestowed upon young 'uns like the two Yadavs. Their fathers – Mulayam Singh and Lalu Prasad – had been part of several such endeavours during their 'Janata' days. One can't be blamed for thinking that the old Janata experiment was the leitmotif throughout Wednesday's event. The throw-back to 1996 was imminent: Deve Gowda was then chosen to lead the central Cabinet by the Janata Dal-led United Front, supported by Congress, to keep the BJP from forming its first government. The passionate movement for building a Ram temple in Ayodhya in place of the Babri Masjid had permanently changed political equations. The Janata Dal was forged in 1988 by former PM VP Singh on a strong anti-Congress plank. He also united a disparate group of leaders from Assam to Tamil Nadu on the same issue. With outside support from the BJP and the Left he ascended the hot seat in 1989. But the very next year he had to give up power after Lalu Yadav – then Bihar CM from Janata Dal – stopped Lal Krishna Advani's Ram juggernaut and arrested him in Samastipur. Tejashwi had not even turned one then; Akhilesh was 13. Deve Gowda's own government tumbled down in 1997 when the Congress, then led by Sitaram Kesri, refused to continue support. For a few more months Inder Kumar Gujaral continued heading that government until eventually the Congress completely withdrew support in 1998. That was the end of the United Front as it was known then. Subsequent efforts to work out 'Third Fronts' proved futile. Twenty years later, the same Deve Gowda was like a mascot on the stage on Wednesday, a nucleus of political heavyweights forming around the swearing-in of his son. The Congress is again in a supporting role with more seats, but as a partner in government this time.  If the goal then was to resist the BJP from assuming power in the aftermath of the Babri demolition (1992) and a corruption-stained reign of PV Narasimha Rao, this time it is to stop the saffron party's victory march and oust it from power. That is a tall task, but ousting the Congress also once looked equally difficult. Yet it was achieved through years of collaboration. Is India looking at another such political realignment? Will it last? After Kumaraswamy's oath-taking one lasting image was him holding hands high with Congress strongman DK Shivakumar. The two Vokkaliga leaders from different parties have had a bitter relationship until now, but Shivakumar was one of the force behind guarding the JD(S)-Congress flock together from being poached by the BJP. If their show of unity survives the topsy-turvy of governance, if the two parties can start for Lok Sabha 2019 United then that can be a primer for all those on the stage Wednesday. And if they do bury mutual differences and ego then BJP chief   should be a worried man. For ensuring Narendra Modi's second term as PM, 31% (voteshare) will then not be enough.",2018-05-23 19:58:00+05:30,, Kumaraswamy swears in amid bonhomie in rainy Bengaluru.

276,Atul Chandra,"Excess sugar is bad not only for one’s health but also that of sugar mills and their owners who are faced with the problem of plenty in Uttar Pradesh. Farmers have their own set of problems as they wait endlessly for factories to clear their arrears which have piled up to Rs 12.25 crore. Sugar alone is not giving the mill owners sleepless nights. Every time there is a bumper sugarcane crop and consequently more sugar production, the output of molasses increases proportionately. While sugar is sold in the wholesale market at lower prices, sale of molasses is tough because of state excise department’s restrictions on sale and movement of the product, and bureaucratic sloth. Total cane crushed by 94 private, 24 co-operative and one government-owned sugar mills in the 2017-18 crushing season totaled 10,821.35 lakh quintals. Till May 18, 2018 these mills had produced 1,081.50 lakh quintals of sugar and the crushing season is still on with some farmers starting the growing season late. With every tonne of crushed cane yielding 46 kg of molasses, this year the output has been to the tune of 235.23 lakh quintals. It’s a double whammy for the Rs 35,000-crore sugar industry, is how a spokesman of UP Sugar Millers’ Association described the glut in sugar and molasses production. This has led to falling of sugar prices from Rs 36-Rs 37 to Rs 26-Rs 27 a kilo on one hand and on the other the government’s clampdown on movement of molasses has forced them to transport it to liquor manufacturers for free. This Rs 12 per kg loss was likely to increase as another bumper sugarcane harvest is predicted. Prices of molassess have also tumbled from Rs 800 per tonne to Rs 250-Rs 400 per tonne. “The more sugarcane and sugar we produce, the more we lose as all cane has to be compulsorily crushed. We cannot close our factories,” the UPSMA spokesman said. And the biggest beneficiaries of this situation are the country liquor distillers as the “government’s restrictive excise policy on molasses is aimed at promoting quality country liquor,” the UPSMA spokesman said adding that this supply was over and above the 12% quota earmarked for distillers. “Production of molasses is well beyond our capacity to consume and hence will have to convert it into free sale in order to be able to sell it outside UP.  But the necessary permission needed from the excise department, both by the buyer and seller, may take months to materialise. Sometimes they just sit over our requests,” the spokesman said.   In fact, to make the movement of molasses more difficult the state cabinet on May 15 hiked the penalty on smuggling of molasses to Rs 1 lakh, along with a jail term of one year. The fine earlier was only Rs 2,000. As the situation stands today, manufacturers are not only facing losses due to lower prices of sugar but also because they have to pour the molasses down the drain. This has added to the problems of mill owners who owe farmers over Rs 12,000 crores. They have warned the government of the complete closure of mills in the coming season. The UPSMA letter to UP Chief Minister   stated that the industry was unable to pay cane arrears any further and with bankers and financial institutions also not coming forward to bail them out, their confidence was totally shaken. “While we have no road map ahead, there is also no certainty on the cane price for the next season and with sugar prices keeping low, we see no future,” the letter said. Ceasing operations would mean about 1.5 lakh workers in sugar mills being rendered jobless and adversely affect 44 lakh farmer families. Gaya Bhushan Pandey of the Hind Mazdoor Sabha said in case of closure the situation would turn grim for about 400 casual workers per mill. Almost an equal number of those who are regular employees on the rolls are a “legal liability” for mill owners. Yogesh Dahiya, a cane grower, dismissed the mill owners’ cry for succour as nonsense. “If there is a glut, why have they allowed 15 million tonnes of sugar to be imported,” he asked and claimed that 6.5 million tonnes of the total import was already at the ports. Dahiya said that 50 lakh families were dependent on sugarcane farming. He was optimistic that like in the past the government will come to the rescue of mill owners with the latter “contributing something to the ruling party’s kitty before the 2019 elections”. Dahiya said, “After all, Prime Minister   promised to double the incomes of farmers, hasn’t he?”  Dharmendra Malik, a member of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, also said the factory owners are in the habit crying over arrears. It is a pressure-building tactic so that the government does not increase the minimum support price for sugarcane in the next season. He said farmers get paid only for the sugar recovered from per quintal of cane. Because of the introduction of a new variety called 38, it is 12 kilos to 14 kilos per quintal. “Farmers are not paid for molasses, which is a by-product,” Malik said. On non-payment of dues, Malik wondered why it is only the big players who default. Some of the smaller companies have paid up to 90 per cent, he said. Farmers are also not paid any interest on the late payment. Malik said factory owners, who are crying over low prices of sugar, sell the commodity at an even lower rate to commercial users like soft drink manufacturers and halwais but for retail buyer there is no relief. Another BKU leader Alok Singh said   government had paid mill owners Rs 14,000 crores to clear their dues. This, when industrialists get subsidy on power and other benefits but will any government pay farmers any subsidy if they incur losses, he asked. “We are not compensated for delayed payments which affect our children’s education, healthcare requirements and other necessities,” Singh said. Yogi Adityanath government had promised to clear within 120 days of taking over and all future payments “within 14 days”. The arrears, which were around Rs 2,000 crore in 2017, have steadily mounted with the “14-day” deadline having been long forgotten. Both the farmers said that by not keeping its promise the BJP government has proved to be no different from the previous governments. “Like others, they too shall pay for it in the elections,” Singh and Malik said.",2018-05-23 16:07:00+05:30,, Why sugar is a bitter problem for Adityanath  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

His withdrawal was a clear sign of things to come – the alliance was safe and would survive the floor test without any trouble. Ramesh Kumar was soon elected Speaker.

282,Joyjeet Das,"One of the key takeaways of the   (third instalment), conducted by research programme Lokniti, Delhi-based Centre for Study of Developing Societies and ABP News is the acceptability that   seems to have gained. He still lags Prime Minister  's appeal but the gap is shrinking and shrinking fast. Almost a quarter (24%) of those who took the survey spontaneously named the Congress President when asked about which leader they would prefer as the PM. Modi retained his lead, with the spontaneous preference of 34% respondents. That makes for a gap of 10 percentage points, much lower than the 17 pp gap between the two as seen in the second instalment of the study only five months ago. In January, 20% of the sample population had rooted for Gandi and 37% for the current PM.  Support for other leaders, most notably West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Bahujan Samaj Party supremo  , remained more or less the same. In one aspect Gandhi actually trumped Modi: While both were liked by 43% respondents, Modi was disliked by 36% and Gandhi by 32%. That makes him a net gainer over Modi. He converted more haters into likers too: 29% compared with Modi's 25%. Also, he lost fewer likers – 35% of those who disliked Modi said they earlier liked him. For Gandhi, the figure was 22%. Notably, a year ago only 9% had named Gandhi. Clearly, he has come a long way in this one year.  In fact political watchers have keenly followed a sort of a transformation in the 47-year-old. Gone are the days when he would be ridiculed as 'Pappu', carrying the baggage of incumbency of a decade-long   government. Modi would tear him and mother Sonia apart at political rallies referring to his 'silver spoon' entitlements. There was a time when his vibes were interpreted as of that of a 'reluctant prince', like his father, former PM Rajeev Gandhi, was once talked about. After the results for the 2014 General Elections became clear, Rahul came for an evening press conference laughing, leaving political watchers bewildered. Congress-led United Progressive Alliance had been throughly trashed in the polls. His image didn't improve in the next couple of years, as was the case with the Grand Old Party's political performance. The only succour was a victory in Bihar as part of the Grand Alliance with the Rashtriya   and Janata Dal (United). Meanwhile he would disappear from the scene, drawing ridicule from political opponents. Loyalty within his party did not disappear though. Early last year he came across as a more keen participant in the political firmamment during elections to the Assemblies of a handful of states. Congress won in Punjab, largely thanks to the leadership of current chief minister Amarinder Singh but lackadaisically let go of opportunities to form government in Goa and Manipur. What was noticed was, however, the way Rahul reached out to   leader and then CM   in Uttar Pradesh. Eventually UP was won by the  , but Rahul succeeded in creating a bond with Akhilesh, three years his junior. Congress shed some of its ennui when it fought tooth and nail to retain Ahmed Patel's Rajya Sabha seat from Gujarat last August. Rahul faced flak again when he left for Italy. But ever since his image has only improved: He cut an impressive figure at an interaction at University of California, Berkeley and kept the tempo going once back home – taking a keener interest in rejigging the party in order to bring back “inner-party democracy”. On the other hand, another interesting show unfolded in the virual sphere, thanks to a young and vibrant social media team led by Divya Spandana. Instead of getting trolled all the time, Team Rahul started giving it back as good as it came. On Twitter, @OfficeOfRG changed to a more personal @RahulGandhi, comunications improved underscored by a nonchalance perhaps best showcased when he introduced his pet dog Pidi. A new, more confident Rahul had unmistakenly took the stage. And twitterati seemed to like it, driving up his follower count. It's currently at 6.9 million – still way behind Modi's 42.6 million, but increasing every day as are the 'likes', which now often overshadow the PM's count. Towards the end of last year he dived headlong into the Gujarat Assembly elections, touring the state extensively, putting up a frontal attack on the incumbent BJP government and promoting young 'uns be it from within Congress (Alpesh Thakore) or from outside ( , Jignesh Mevani). The hardwork paid off. Nobody thought the Congress to oust the BJP in the PM's backyard, but the results were way closer than expected – BJP stopped at 99, with Congress only 22 seats behind. By the time the results were out Rahul had assumed the office of party chief. In March this year he stamped his authority on the party at its two-day plenary, ramping up the offensive against the incumbent government. The recently concluded Karnataka elections saw him take charge, touring the state extensively, trying to set an agenda without stepping into distractions put up the the BJP. The Congress lost, but ensured that the BJP would be kept out of power by swift coalition politics – an 180-degree turn of the image it put across in Goa and Manipur last year. His work is likely to only intensify with elections lined up in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, building up the crescendo to next year's general elections. The image makeover would surely come in handy. The survey released Thursday too indicates that his sustained stands on issues related to the marginalised sections of the society were paying off. Among Dalit respondents, 25% preferred Rahul as the next PM, up from 18% five months ago. That ties with Modi's ratings among the community, which in fact has shrunk from 35%. Among Adivasis, Rahul's acceptability was even higher – 30%, up from 27%. Modi, on the other hand, dropped to 37% from 42%. If these trends continue along with the new-found bonhomie among Opposition parties, PM Modi should start worrying.

289,Charu Kartikeya,"The real objective of   National General Secretary Ram Madhav's purported ode to democracy published in the   appears to be to shield his party's national leadership from criticism over their failure at the hustings in Karnataka. Madhav has tried to cleverly argue that the blame for the BJP's inability to win absolute majority and form the government on its own lies at the doors of the party's state leadership.  The paeans to democracy that accompany his argument appear irrelevant, ironical and contrived, given the history of his own conduct as well as that of his party's. The BJP's attempts at subterfuge in state after state have been amply documented. In the case of Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi and, most recently, Karnataka, the party's underhand tricks were overturned by the courts. In all these cases, the judgements became a source of embarrassment for the high constitutional offices of the President, the Governor and the Chief Election Commissioner. To see Madhav quote ethicists and wax eloquent on democracy for defending this kind of a record is deeply ironical. To cap it all, he himself is known as a poll 'manager' and he recently exposed his own belief in the 'all is fair' principle on live TV. When asked about the party's plan of action if it failed to secure majority in the Karnataka Assembly, a chuckling Madhav told the show's anchors, “Hamare paas   hai”. This was a brazen expression of pride over the reputation that the BJP's national president enjoys, of being adept in bending all kinds of electoral contests in his party's favour.That even Shah could not manage to finally deliver the state to his party turned out to be deeply embarrassing for them. Congress and the   (Secular) gave Shah and his party a bitter dose of their own medicine by denying them the chance of forming a government in spite of emerging as the single largest party. The fact that there was nothing illegal about it showed the BJP that it was time the party stopped believing that it alone possesses the tricks that help parties move ahead in the cut-throat arena of politics in India. At the end of the day only one fact remained. While the governing Congress was given a thumbs-down by the electorate, the BJP too failed to win the required confidence of the people. Who was responsible for it is a matter of debate and analysis. What Madhav's arguments indicate that the BJP wants its chief ministerial candidate BS Yeddyurappa to bear the burden of failure on his shoulders, so that people do not get the chance to associate it with Shah or Prime Minister  . Why else would he argue that “Assembly elections, especially in states in the country’s south and east, need strong regional leadership” and that “the provincial leadership of the BJP in respective states should be asked to shoulder the greater burden?” However, how does the BJP expect people to believe that? Didn't Shah spend months preparing the party's electoral strategy for Karnataka? He didn't leave anything to chance on the ground too and campaigned in almost all of the 30 districts of the state. Modi, the party's campaigner in chief, was to be the man of the match, a magic batsman of sorts who will come in in the slog overs and take home the trophy for his team.  The PM addressed as many as 21 rallies in the state, as Madhav himself admits, and yet failed to act as the clincher. Average BJP voters are upset that the party failed to upstage Congress even in the underhand tricks department. The loud and clear message of Madhav's piece is that the unexpected turn of events in Karnataka has got the BJP's goat. The party is facing great difficulty in digesting that the Opposition may finally be gaining some ground and beginning to understand what may work for it in 2019. That's the reason why Madhav, Shah and Modi are slamming opposition parties' efforts to unite as an “unholy and unprincipled alliance”. They are telling their followers that thugs are ganging up against them. To win, they are appealing for an overwhelming majority in the next Lok Sabha polls, a 51% mandate, through even bigger numbers than what the party got in 2014. Even the party's most ardent well-wishers are doubting that, as of now.",2018-05-30 18:58:00+05:30,, Why Ram Madhav's ode to democracy is an ironical camouflage  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

297,Sebastian Sunny,"May 12 is World Migratory Bird Day (WMBD). In fact, the day that follows, May 13 also is part of the WMBD. This year WMBD is important for more than one reason. The first and the foremost is that this year the focus is on unifying the planet’s major bird corridors or flyways—the African Eurasian Flyway, the East Asian-Australasian Flyway and the American Flyway. The WMBD 2018 has “Unifying our voices for bird conservation” as its theme.WMBD 2018 is significant again, as it is for the first time that two major bird conservation days, the International Migratory Bird Day and the World Migratory Bird Day, have been combined. This was decided in October last year at the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS COP 12), held at the Philippines capital, Manila. The new partnership, it has been said, is a “bid to strengthen global recognition and appreciation of migratory birds and highlight the urgent need for their conservation”. It has also been decided that WMBD will be observed again in the year on the second Saturday in October. The activities of these days would focus on education on migratory birds and spreading awareness about the need to protect their habitats and flyways. As many as 2000 species of birds, that is 20 per cent of all known bird species, make regular seasonal movements. Migration is an activity akin to both humans and animals. Bird migration is a regular seasonal movement, along the flyways and between the breeding and wintering grounds. There are many states identified with bird migration and Rajasthan used to be known for the winter sojourns of the rare Siberian cranes in the Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur every year till the turn of the century. Other well known winter  migrants include the highly threatened Yellow breasted bunting, Amur falcon, Sociable lapwing, Blackpoll warbler, Rufous hummingbird, Ruff, Black winged stilt, Common teal, Common green shank, Northern pintail, Yellow wagtail, White wagtail, Rosy pelican, Gadwall, Wood sandpiper, Spotted sandpiper, Eurasian Wigeon, Black tailed godwit, Blue throat, Long billed pipit and Starling. Among the summer migrants are Asian koel, Black crowned night heron, Eurasian golden oriole, Comb duck, Blue cheeked bee eater, Blue tailed bee eater and Cuckoos. Demoiselle cranes, popularly called 'kurja', come to India from Mongolia.  The Red Knot is an iconic American species which travels nearly 14000 kms each spring from the base of Argentina to Canadian Arctic in order to breed. At the turn of the century over 50,000 Red Knots wintered at Tierra del Fuego in Argentina. Aerial surveys in 2017 indicated a disturbing development about their population—there were fewer than 9,000 of them, an all time low.      Birds are categories into “local” and “migratory” going by their habitats, movement and breeding locations. ”Do remember, this is a mistake often committed by most people, including the press reporters. Migratory birds are those which do not breed in places of their migration. As for those migrating to India they may breed over the Himalayas, in Tibet/Ladakh, or North West Frontier areas in Pakistan and Afghanistan or further up in Siberia or China or Mongolia”, observes eminent conservationist Harsh Vardhan. Migration is beset with perils for the birds. Bird migration, driven by weather conditions and food availability, carries high cost of predation and mortality. The migratory birds face threats from poachers and degradation of flyways and habitats along the route. The loss of critical stopover sites such as coastal wetlands, marshes, illegal killing, poisoning, tourism and poor waste management are some of the aspects endangering their lives. According to Birdlife International more than 40 per cent of the migratory birds are declining and nearly 200 are now classified as threatened.  “Birds are doing their best to find ways to live among people, but they are birds after all—they don’t know how to navigate human dominated landscapes,” points out David Yarnold of the Birdlife USA. In these perilous times for migratory birds, how to keep a track on their flyways, habitats and their well being through the journeys, at times involving thousands of kilometers?  “Bird banding or ringing is the most ideal tool to ascertain which bird migrated to which destination and took how many days to do so. This scientific procedure reveals status of any species, declining or being all right. It is done all over the world,” Harsh Vardhan notes. However, sadly in India it is not being carried out. “The Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is the sole agency to do it. It is neither doing itself nor allowing others to do so. Can we amend the current practice to enable young bird watchers join this work? It can be an exciting new profession for many,” he argues.     ",2018-05-12 20:28:00+05:30,, World Migratory Bird Day  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

299,Rajeev Khanna,"Chief Ministers heading   (BJP) governments in various states seem to be taking the much peddled ‘Modi Model’ a bit too far. They are too engrossed in following whatever Prime Minister   has been doing in his earlier avatar as the Gujarat Chief Minister and now as the Prime Minister of the country. It is a well known fact by now that Modi leaves no occasion or event to garner positive press coverage for himself in his quest to develop himself as a brand even though the event might be of little or no consequence or something that is too personal a matter. Now it is the CMs who have started speaking his language on every occasion. This phenomenon can be best highlighted by the Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Singh Rawat’s drive for publicity. One just needs to sample the brief press note that the state’s information department circulated on Sunday night that had the headline, 'Within an hour of complaint on CM’s Uttarakhand Mobile App, help provided for the cremation of cow' The press note then went on to read, “On a complaint lodged on Uttarakhand CM’s Mobile App at 5 pm on 12 May, the Chief Minister’s office got information that a cow has died in Gaushala of Amit Singh at Kartar Dairy Farm Missarwala Kala, Doiwala but on account of second-Saturday holiday, they did not got any assistance for the cremation of the cow and next day as well, the offices were supposed to remain closed because of Sunday. “After making hectic efforts the whole day, Amit Singh lodged a complaint seeking help on the CM Uttarakhand Mobile App on May 12 at 5 pm. Acting promptly for the redressal of the complaint, ADM, Dehradun and Doiwala police were intimated. After receiving information from CM’s office, police and administrative officials reached Amit Singh’s Gaushala within an hour and got the cow cremated. Amit Singh has thanked the Uttarakhand Chief Minister. Trivendra Singh Rawat and Dehradun district administration and Doiwala police.” One can see that things have come to a pass that ‘cremation’ of a cow has also become an event of sorts to get publicity. Just the day before, Rawat’s publicity wing was circulating media briefs on how he remembered his mother Late Bodha Devi with the message that every mother loves the youngest child the most and being the youngest in the family, he was showered with utmost love and affection. He added that whenever he had wished to go for his studies, social or political works, his parents always encouraged him. He said whatever he has achieved or whatever position he has reached was only due to his parents. Rawat said where ever he stayed, he used to get time to meet his mother and spent time with his parents. Now is it not similar to what Modi has been doing using the pictures of his mother at various occasions including the demonetisation fallout. The media has been too keen to show his picture taking his mother around and her also travelling in an auto. If he can indulge in such publicity gimmicks, why can’t the likes of Rawat. On the occasion of the ‘Mother’s Day’ he even sent out a public address to the mothers that was more of a preaching. The message read, “It is being said that mother and motherland are great than the heaven and I feel myself very fortunate that with your love and blessings, I got the privilege to serve you both. The respect with which I served my mother, with same feelings, I am committed to serve my motherland Uttarakhand.” Observers have been pointing that his entire political narrative is around ‘Modi’s dreams’ that he has been trying to fulfill. “The whole narrative of the ‘Double Engine Sarkar’ where the same party is in power in both the state and the centre is being played to the hilt. The fact is that the government is yet to come out with some concrete achievement to show. The issues on which this government was elected to power remain unresolved. Political posturing and rhetoric is being dished out continuously while a huge effort is being made to build a positive image through media,” said a senior political adviser. What is on display is making the ‘Modi Model’ work all across where hype and hoopla overshadow the actual performance. Uttarakhand seems to be following this model in all earnestness.",2018-05-14 20:01:00+05:30,, How BJP CMs are taking the 'Modi Model' of branding a bit too far | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

308,Joyjeet Das,"It hit the roof. Not that it was not expected. The fight for the chief ministership of Karnataka took an ugly turn and the Supreme Court had to open its gates post-midnight. Eventually the apex court refused to stay the process of   (BJP) state chief BS Yeddyurappa's oath-taking as chief minister, scheduled for 9 AM Thursday morning. Significantly, during the course of the past-midnight hearing of Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi's petition, the defence put it before the court that no anti-defection law would be applicable onto any member of the legislative assembly (MLA) before they are sworn-in. This would potentially make things easier for Yeddyurappa to fill up the seven-seat gap between him and chief ministership. The Shikaripura strongman was invited to form the government on Wednesday night by Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala, an old confidant of Prime Minister  . After keeping the state on tenterhooks throughout the day and meeting both the BJP and the Congress-  (Secular) combine and issued the invite only aroun 9 PM, leaving only about 12 hours for the swearing-in. Contrary to this haste, he granted the CM-designate 15 days to prove that he enjoys support of the majority of MLAs. Expectedly, this made the Congress-JD(S) alliance see red. But instead of taking another punch on its face after Goa, Manipur and Meghalaya, the Grand Old Party this time decided to give it back. Petitioning the Supreme Court against Vala's decision, Singhvi pleaded that the case be heard in the intervening night itself and a stay be granted. The apex court decided to do just that and a three-judge Bench took the case up right away. The Bench constituted by Chief Justice Dipak Misra comprised Justices AK Sikri, A Bobde and Ashok Bhushan.  Singhvi argued that the court would not be approachable once a CM was sworn in. He pointed out the respective strengths of the bickering sides: 104 for the BJP and 116 for the Congress-JD(S) combine, according to media reports. Singhvi argued that giving 15 days to Yeddyrappa to prove that he enjoyed the confidence of the majority of members would encourage the ""constitutional sin of poaching"". The Bench pointed out that the BJP had the most number of members and the Congress-JD(S) alliance was a post-polls arrangement. The government was being represented by Additional Solicitor Journal Tushar Mehta. On the BJP's behalf former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi was present. Before entering the courtroom he told reporters that the court could not intervene in the matter. Whether or not the BJP had the numbers could be proven only on the floors of the House. Current Attorney General KK Venugopal also reportedly arrived at the court. In his arguement, Singhvi cited the example of Goa where the BJP was invited to, and it did, form the government despite the Congress being the single-largest party. Citing past examples, he argued there was no reason to deviate at the present. The court considered the point whether it should restrain the governor, something if it wishes to do would have to be done before Yeddyurappa takes his oath at 9 AM. When the court wondered whether there would be an administrative vaccum, Singhvi pointed out that a caretaker government was already in place. The Congress leader argued that the governor's special privileges were also open to judicial scrutiny. In the past, the only time that the apex court opened its gate for hearing past midnight was before the execution of the capital punishment of Yakub Memon in the Mumbai bombing case. After Singhvi concluded his argument, Rohatgi started his. He argued that the hearing of the petition in the wee hours was ""totally wrong"". Saying the case was was based on speculations, he maintained the line that the court did not have jurisdiction over the matter. The court interestingly raised the issue of swearing-in the members of the House before the CM, which the government opposed citing precedents. The defence presented before the court that any anti-defection law would not apply before members were sworn-in. This means that they would be free to support any candidate of their choice for chief ministership.  The Supreme Court said it was worried about the situation and asked why the governor gave Yeddyurappa 15 days to prove his majority. Though the Bench refused to stay the swearing-in, it also did not dismiss Singhvi's petition, saying it was ""subject of hearing later on"". It issued notices to respondents, including Yeddyurappa. Despite the court refusing to stay the proceedings, Singhvi kept arguing that the swearing-in be at least postponed to Thursday evening so that relevant documents could be examined.",2018-05-17 02:20:00+05:30,, Battle for Karnataka: Supreme Court refuses to stay Yeddyurappa's oath-taking | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
309,Atul Chandra,"Sunil Singh, the former president of Hindu Yuva Vahini (HYV) who was expelled from the outfit for fielding candidates for the 2017 Assembly elections in defiance of  ’s directives, announced floating of a parallel outfit in Lucknow. Singh was one of the founder members of HYV. Coming close on the heels of the  ’s shocking defeat in Gorakhpur, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s constituency, the development may not be good news for the mahant of the Gorakhnath mutt.  Sunil Singh was elected national president of Hindu Yuva Vahini - Bharat (HYV-B) at a meeting of its national executive in Lucknow Sunday evening. As chief patron of HYV, Yogi Adityanath appointed Singh its president in 2002. The social and cultural outfit earned notoriety for using strong-arm tactics to propagate Hindutva, protect cows, tackle love jihad and enforce ghar wapsi. He is a firm believer in aggressive Hindutva. While Singh’s move would seem to be a challenge to Adityanath’s authority in Gorakhpur and other parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh, he himself clarified that his organisation will only carry forward the Yogi’s agenda of Hindutva, which was his life’s mission with power being only a “commercial break”. Sunil Singh said he would work towards the creation of a 'Hindu Rashtra', which was also the dream of Mahant Avaidyanath, Adityanath’s guru. He added that the Hindu Yuva Vahini had moved away from Hindutva and its members were now more into land grabbing and contractual work from government.  The HYV-B will soon launch a membership drive and a movement for the construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, he said. HYV General Secretary PK Mall said Singh was playing into the hands of the   and that his organisation had nothing to do with either Singh or the HYV-B. In 2017, Sunil Singh had fielded candidates in about a dozen eastern UP seats threatening to dent the BJP’s poll prospects. An angry Adityanath expelled him. Singh described his sacking as illegal and unconstitutional. He then said that Adityanath “has left his mission” and was running after the BJP. There may be some truth in Sunil Singh’s charge that the HYV cadres were into land-grabbing and government’s contract as within two months of Yogi becoming the CM, the BJP raised the red flag over the “outsider” Vahini’s growing clout. The issue was first raised by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, who had not relinquished the post of party president until then. At the state executive meeting last May 2017 he said “outsiders” were getting preferential treatment in the government while the party cadre was being disregarded. This, he said, was unacceptable. Maurya dismissed HYV as a threat to the BJP. The increasing complaints against ochre scarf-wearing men harassing people in the name of Hindutva and cow vigilantism also prompted Adityanath to warn that he would expose imposters who were “misusing” saffron to malign his government. In April 2017, Adityanath reportedly held separate meetings with HYV and the RSS workers and urged Vahini members to maintain “decency”, not use saffron as the party’s colour, monitor government work and flag any discrepancies to their colleagues in HYV and not misbehave with any officer. The increase in violence in the name of love jihad and cow protection, forced the HYV to stop its membership drive for one year. The HYV’s general secretary PK Mall, a close associate of Adityanath, stated that his organization will not accept any new membership for the next six months. There was an “exponential” growth in HYV’s membership after Adityanath became CM, Mall claimed. As Sunil Singh has returned to haunt the BJP and Adityanath, so far neither has reacted to his announcement on either forming HYV-B or on carrying forward Yogi’s ‘mission’. It is possible that, as alleged by Mall, Singh has Samajwadi Party’s backing. Whether it will be politically advantageous for  , and to what extent, would be known only later.",2018-05-16 16:53:00+05:30,, Ex-protege may now be irritant for Adityanath | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
310,Rajeev Khanna,"Karnataka Governor Vajubhai Vala's move invitation to   (BJP) leader BS Yeddyurappa for being the chief minister and the grant of 15 days to prove that he has the support of the majority of members of the legislative assembly has raised several eyebrows. But it was expected. Vala, after all, has a   (RSS) lineage. He has been known for toeing the line of the party's central leadership, ignoring individual or groups. “  (this was bound to happen),” is what you hear when you bring the topic up with any politically aware Gujarati back home. People who have known him from say Vala has been loyal only to his party and not to his caste or community. “This can be ascertained from the fact that the Rajkot II seat, which later became Rajkot (West) that he represented right from 1985 onwards until 2012 hardly has any Karadia Rajput strength, the community to which he belongs. He has just been loyal to the BJP leadership. “At one point of time he was the finance minister in the Cabinet led by former CM Keshubhai Patel and then he acquired the same place in the Cabinet led by   in his avatar of the Gujarat chief minister. The transition in the top leadership never affected him,” pointed out a veteran political analyst based in Rajkot who has seen Vala's journey from a bicycle to a limousine. Vala was a seven-time MLA who held the record for presenting eighteen budgets in the Gujarat assembly before he went to become the speaker in Gujarat Assembly and the governor of Karnataka. Before becoming a MLA, Vala had been a corporator and also the mayor of the town and old timers still recall him as the 'Paaniwala Mayor' because the drinking water crisis in Rajkot had eased a bit during his tenure because of the supply coming from Bhadar Dam. Having joined the RSS during his school days, Vajubhai was among the top leaders of the BJP in Saurashtra at the time of its inception along with Keshubhai Patel and Chiman Shukla. “Vala still leaves no opportunity to come to Rajkot and attend social programmes. He has no qualms in saying that he has been rewarded well by his party for the services rendered by him. He is a qualified lawyer who never practiced,” said the observer. This is pretty evident as he was duly rewarded for having vacated his seat in 2001 when Modi was looking for a constituency after his anointment as the chief minister. Modi wanted to contest from Ellisbridge constituency in Ahmedabad but former home minister Haren Pandya denied to vacate the seat for him. It was Vala who vacated the Rajkot (West) seat for him. This seat is known to be the safest BJP seat in Gujarat. From the next election in 2002 that was held in the aftermath of Godhra train-burning incident and the subsequent anti-Muslim pogrom Modi went on to contest successfully thrice from Maninagar seat before he chose to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.  But he made it sure that Pandya was denied a ticket from Ellisbridge in 2002. Vala went back to his home turf in 2002, won and came back as the finance minister. It was after the 2012 Gujarat Assembly polls that he was made the speaker and subsequently sent to Karnataka in 2014. There are many political observers in Gujarat who are convinced that Modi had seen the possibility of a scenario that has emerged in Karnataka and had taken the timely action of sending his 'yes man' as the state governor and Vala according to them definitely has not let his party down. There are others who point that once Vala was made the governor, it was the rival group led by the current Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani that has established itself in Vala's constituency of Rajkot (West). Rupani won the polls from this seat in the recent polls, As a BJP politician Vala is known as a leader who equated development in rising land prices. He is known to have a keen interest in the real estate sector. Sources say that the booming of shopping malls and multiplexes in Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Vadodara can be dedicated to him because of the easy clearances coming from his revenue ministry that he had along with finance. There are many people who vouch that while even being in Bangaluru, he still keeps a tab on the real estate sector developments in his home state. Vala is also known for his political one liners and 'crude jokes' that he loves cracking in his native Kathiawadi. He never allowed the assembly sessions in Gujarat to be dull even for a single day both as a minister and as the speaker as his one liners provided enough humour to keep everyone alert. Coming back to the present scenario in Karnataka, what is visible is a role reversal of sorts between Vala and   (Secular) leader HD Deve Gowda. It was 22 years ago, when Vala was the BJP president in Gujarat and the Union government led by Deve Gowda had dismissed his party’s ministry led by chief minister Suresh Mehta, following unprecedented violence in the Gujarat Assembly. Now it is Vala holding the strings in Deve Gowda's home turf of Karnataka as the latter's son Kumaraswamy stakes claim to form the government in an alliance with the Congress. The 'nataka' in Karnataka is definitely not ending soon and Vala will continue to play an important role in how things unfold in the days to come.",2018-05-17 17:56:00+05:30,, Vajubhai Vala inviting Yeddyurappa isn't a surprise.

311,Rajeev Khanna,"His acquittal in a three decade-old road rage case from the Supreme Court is all set to broaden the area of influence of cricketer-turned-politician  , not only in Punjab politics but in the larger design of the Congress as well. With the shackles of a probable conviction that could have eclipsed his political growth gone, Sidhu now has the opportunity to carve out a niche and a path for his political growth within the grand old party. There are many in Punjab who feel that Sidhu, who is the current local bodies minister and finance minister Manpreet Badal are the most prominent names when it comes to assuming a successor of the state Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Just before the Punjab Assembly polls last year, it was being assumed that Sidhu might be given the designation of deputy chief minister but that was not to be. Offering the post to someone who had just joined the party a few days ahead of the polls would have led to a crisis within the party. This was followed by an era where the messages that came out were that every effort was made to confine him to a corner in the political set up. To begin with, he was given the portfolio of local bodies and culture which are seen as 'lightweight' ministries. More recently, he was cold-shouldered when it came to election of the Mayor in Amritsar after he Congress secured a comfortable win in the local bodies elections there. This was an insult to him as he has been representing Amritsar both as a MLA and Lok Sabha member. To add to this, he had no say in the local body polls in Patiala, Jalandhar and Amritsar that went to polls in December despite being the local bodies minister. But observers feel that now all this will change. “The baggage of the fear of conviction has gone. He will no be more aggressive in the days to come,” pointed a political observer.He is all set to emerge as a new pole in the Congress in Punjab. Sidhu has been the most vocal of the Congress leaders who has been seeking action against Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader Bikramjit Singh Majithia on the issue of drugs and has been calling for steps to rope in the 'cable mafia' in the state that had prospered during the previous Akali-  (BJP) regime. On both these issues Amarinder has taken a 'cautious approach' that has not gone down well both among the Congress cadres as well as the masses. Over the last one year there were indications that his perceived closeness to Congress President   was also on the rocks on account of is not campaigning for the party candidates in both the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. These were two states where he had been listed as a star campaigner and his popularity as a cricketer and a good orator would have surely helped, particularly in the high profile Gujarat elections where Rahul had made extra efforts to ensure a much better performance than before. There is a point of view that this baggage of the road rage case had lots to do with Sidhu not taking on the saffron brigade in these two states. But this perception seems to be changing again if one looks at the speech Sidhu made at the Congress plenary session in Delhi in March, where he made full use of his oratory to convey that he is all committed to the party leadership. Now after his acquittal there are reports that Rahul, Amarinder and Priyanka were among the first to convey their congratulations to him. He too messaged Rahul, “I am now at the disposal of the party 24x7. My life is yours.” Sidhu is learnt to have met Rahul after a brief meeting with Amarinder on Tuesday afternoon. Sidhu's political journey started from the BJP and reached the Congress barely a few weeks ahead of the 2017 Punjab assembly polls. He was both a Lok Sabha and a Rajya Sabha member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He had decided not to contest the 2014 Lok Sabha poll after he was denied a party ticket to contest from Amritsar and was replaced by   as the party candidate. He declined the offer to contest from elsewhere. The party sent him to Rajya Sabha in 2016 to prevent him from joining the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) ahead of the polls. There were numerous speculations about Sidhu making a deal with AAP. He finally joined the Congress after launching a political front, Awaz-e-Punjab, along with prominent Hockey player Pargat Singh and the Bains brothers of Lok Insaf Party. It can now be expected that the Congress will make full use of him during the campaign in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh that go to the polls a few months down the line. The party needs good orators to counter the speeches made by Prime Minister   at the fag end of poll campaign in various states that are known to turn the tables in favour of the BJP. In Punjab, he will now be going full throttle to have his way in matters of governance. In all his political profile is all set for a boost in the days to come.",2018-05-16 18:30:00+05:30,," After Supreme Court acquittal, Sidhu's politics may get more bite | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

313,Anurag Dey,"The Supreme Court Friday ordered Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yeddyurappa to demonstrate before the state legislative assembly that he enjoys support of the majority of its members, curtailing the 15-day period provided to him by Governor Vajubhai Vala. The floor test will be taken at 4 pm Saturday and a pro-tem speaker will decide the evenutalities in accordance with law, a three-judge Bench said. It barred the newly elected government from taking any major policy decision until then. The apex court also ordered the state government and the Governor to not nominate any member from the Anglo-Indian community to the House and directed the state police chief to ensure security of all MLAs.  A suggestion that the floor test be conducted by secret ballot was rejected. The Bench of Justices AK Sikri, SA Bobde and Ashok Bhushan was listening to a petition by Karnataka Congress chief G Paremeshwara and   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy against the decision of Governor Vajubhai Vala to invite the   to form government. “Let the House decide and the best course would be floor test,” the Bench said while clarifying that it will deal with the constitutionality of Vala's decision later. Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who argued for the represented the Congress-JD(S) MLAs, termed the orders historic. During the hearing, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi representing Yeddyurappa, opposed the floor test on Saturday and pleaded for it be conducted on Monday. He also submitted letters sent by the CM to the Governor staking claim to form the government. Earlier in a pre-dawn hearing on Thursday on an urgent basis, the Bench had asked for the letters to the Governor, while refusing to stay Yeddyurappa's swearing-in. The rare hearing took place after Singhvi approached the top court with the petition seeking to stall the oath-taking ceremony scheduled hours laterm, at 9 AM Thursday. Yeddyurappa, through his counsel told the court that Congress-JS(S) tie-up was not a pre-poll alliance and the BJP being the single-largest party had the people’s mandate and rightfully staked claim. Meanwhile, the Congress which has shifted all its newly elected Karnataka MLAs to Hyderabad to prevent them from poaching, continued to target the Governor Vala and the BJP while hailing the court’s order. Congress President   celebrated the order:Former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah too attacked the governor:  Meanwhile the BJP asserted Yeddyurappa will be supported by more than 120 MLAs. “The Supreme Court has ordered to prove majority in the assembly tomorrow at 4 pm. BJP welcomes this. We are confident that tomorrow at 4 pm BJP legislators and those supporting it will prove majority,"" Karnataka BJP General Secretary Shobha Karandlaje said. Ashwani Kumar, law minister in the previous   Cabinet, said the court’s order would play a major role in ensuring that governors exercise discretion fairly: “The Court’s order is a vindication of democracy, vindication of the Constitution. I believe the court has vindicated itself as the ultimate arbiter of the Constitution. I believe the decision of the Governor to call Yeddyurappa to form the government was wholly unconstitutional and politically unethical. “The exercise of discretion under Article 164 (of the Constitution) is in nature of sovereign prerogative.

315,Joyjeet Das,"Bookanakere Siddalingappa Yeddyurappa rose on the floor of Bengaluru's majestic Vidhana Saudha Saturday afternoon after all newly elected members were sworn in. But instead of seeking the support of the majority of those members, the chief minister of Karnataka launched a melodramatic speech. By the time it was 4 pm -- when the House to vote -- he had given up on the fight, the first such instance in a long time from the safforn camp. The   tried to hardsell Yeddyurappa's move as an elegant one. But the fact is that it just lost a crucial battle after announcing to everyone who cared to hear that the party would win it handsomely. Controversial Governor Vajubhai Vala now doesn't seem to have much option than to invite   (Secular) leader HD Kumaraswamy to govern the state. The way his party as well as the   have been able to guard their MLAs, Kumaraswamy seems to be in comfortable position to sail through a trust vote. He has put a very condifent image forward ever since Vala invited Yeddyurappa, and not him, to form government. The former CM and son of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda consistently maientained that all non-BJP MLAs were united and there were no cases of defection. In fact he went a step further and threatened to poach two of the BJP's MLAs if it tried to take one from his party. Legislators of both parties had a tough time in the last two days, after Vala Thursday backed his old party BJP, shifting from a resort to Hyderabad and back. Two Congress MLAs reportedly remained untraceable until Saturday and there were several allegations that the BJP was trying to buy its way into governing a state in South India, where it governs none. That alone has made Karnataka an important fight for BJP President  , who has delivered state after state to the saffron party's kitty. Not only did he fail in his Mission 150, but the tally of 104 seats was way lower than the ""at least 130"" he had vowed to get even on the last day of campaigning. This despite Prime Minister  's extensive  campaign in all regions of Karnataka. A friendly governor still ensured them pole position but a spirited fight by the Congress-JD(S) camp -- getting the Supreme Court to open its gates past midnight -- negated  everything.  After the results, in fact, the fight gradually spread out from Karnataka to attract other regional parties as well.  's Bahujan Samaj Party is anyway a partner in the coalition, supported also by  . West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee vocally advocated a Congress-JD(S) tie-up. Her Kerala counterpart Pinarayi Vijayan's tourism department offered to house the MLAs of the combine. When Kumaraswamy reached out to Andhra CM Chandrababu Naidu, he reportedly offered three places for the MLAs to camp. Eventually the choice was Hyderabad where K Chandrasekhara Rao's police kept them protected. In Bihar,   raised the demand that if Yeddyurappa could be CM for leading the single-largest party, his Rashtriya Janata Dal should be allowed to do the same. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary   and Jammu and Kashmir National Conference leader Omar Abdullah castigated the BJP for its strong-arm tactics. Basically, not only the BJP failed to manage the numbers, it also brought the Opposition together. Also, none of its ally came out in support. With General Elections a year away, that doesn't augur well at all for the BJP. This doesn't mean that work is over for the Congress and JD(S). It, in fact, has just begun. They are yet to form the government. If and when it does, all eyes will be on them. The slightest of missteps, may that be in governance or in cooperation, will be harshly judged. Still, they have landed a chance to take on the formidable BJP-RSS machinery. Several parties across the country will be watching them closely as will do the people of Karnataka.",2018-05-19 18:25:00+05:30,, Yeddyurappa runs away from floor test.

318,Charu Kartikeya,"In a display of the majesty of the Indian Constitution's scheme of checks and balances, the Supreme Court Friday made a massive intervention in the process of government formation in Karnataka. After the midnight courtroom drama two days ago, all eyes were on the top court today, as it resumed the hearing on the Congress party's petition challenging Governor Vajubhai Vala's invitation to  's BJP's BS Yeddyurappa to form the government. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court came to the conclusion that “floor test to ascertain the majority of one or the other group is conducted immediately and without any delay”. The top court's order bringing down the time given by Governor Vala to Yeddyurappa to prove majority in the Assembly from 15 days to just one was a momentous ruling. It will be remembered and cited as a landmark precedent from now on. It had been widely argued that the Governor's conduct in matters of government formation was beyond judicial scrutiny, but the apex court has proved that to be a fallacy. The verdict will stand as a lesson for future governments elsewhere too since abuse of the discretionary power given to a Governor by the Constitution was a rampant practice so far. For Karnataka, this verdict will mean that the BJP camp will get only about one day now to get non-BJP MLAs to defect. The BJP has 104 MLAs, 8 short of the magic number required to prove majority in the Assembly. Congress-JD(S) combine has 117 MLAs. Fearing poaching of MLAs from their camp, Congress and JD(S) had packed off their MLAs to a resort in Hyderabad. They were gearing up for a 15-day stay, but are on their way back to Bengaluru now. Though the SC order does not reprimand the Governor for giving Yeddyurappa 15 days, the order itself is an embarrassment for Vala. In his letter to him seeking the crucial invitation, Yeddyurappa made no effort to convince the Governor that he had the numbers and yet the Governor invited him.The embarrassment for BJP is heavier in light of the fact that Vala has become the second NDA Governor to have his actions overturned by the courts. In July 2016, the SC restored the Congress-led government in Arunachal Pradesh, after terming as “illegal” and “violative of constitutional provisions” Governor JP Rajkhowa’s advancement of the session of the state Assembly. The advancement had triggered an intense round of political crisis in the state leading to the imposition of President’s Rule on January 26. Uttarakhand's case must also be recalled, wherein the Uttarakhand High Court quashed the Centre's decision to impose President's Rule in the state, April 2016. Challenging the arbitrariness that was evident in the imposition of President's Rule, the SC had noted that “there is no king or absolutism. Howsoever high you are, the law is above you.” BJP as well as all other political parties must heed to these three judgments. They must always remember that no one should get so arrogant to assume that in the name of Constitutional powers they will do anything and get away with it.

In several states even electoral failure couldn't stop it from assuming power. But its desperation for an encore, in Karnataka, has boomeranged. After Governor Vajubhai Vala appointed BS Yeddyurappa chief minister despite the BJP not having a majority in the legislative assembly, a large section of the political spectrum cried foul. So intense was the bitterness that demands were raised to follow the same principle and bring down BJP governments in Goa, Bihar and Manipur. After a night-long drama, when the Supreme Court did not stay the morning swearing-in, the anger was palpable in Opposition parties. If the BJP could get a chance for being the single-largest party (SLP) in Karnataka, the Congress should also get the same chance in Goa and Manipur, the Grand Old Party claimed. Tejaswi Yadav demanded the same for Rashtriya   in Bihar.  Their claims found considerable support from other parties. On the other hand, not even its allies came out vocally in support of the BJP.The BJP had drawn considerable flak March last year after it scooped away Goa and Manipur despite the Congress being the SLP.  In Goa, Governor Mridula Sinha accepted the BJP's claim that it enjoyed majority support though it managed to win only 13 of the 40 Assembly seats, and invited it to form the government. The Congress, on the other hand, was at 17 – closer to the majority mark of 21.  The then Defence Minister   flew back to his native state to become CM with the support of the Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party, the Goa Forward Party, the Nationalist Congress Party and Independent members. Manipur followed the same pattern: The Congress was not invited despite having 28 members – three short of majority. And the BJP, with 21 MLAs, cobbled an alliance with the Naga People's Front, the National People's Party (NPP), the Lok Janshakti Party and a renegade Trinamool Congress MLA. Aspersions were cast that the BJP could pull these off thanks to faithful governors and rampant horse-trading. A few months later, last July, Bihar Chief Minister   put in his papers citing differences with ally Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). The BJP swooped right in with its 53 MLAs to back the 71 of his Janata Dal (United). Again, the SLP – in this case RJD with 80 MLAs – didn't get a chance. Earlier this year, the Congress again missed the bus in Meghalaya bus. In this case, however, it was tied with the NPP with 20 seats each in the 60-member House. But the later got support from the BJP and others to form the government. These inctances came back to haunt the BJP Thursday when the Congress and the RJD raised demanded that either the principle of Karnataka should now be levied in such states or the Congress-JD(S) alliance be given a chance to prove its majority there. Goa Pradesh Congress President Girish Chodankar sought time from the Governor to lay claim over the government there. He later tweeted that the party has got a Friday noon appointment with her. Manipur Congress leader and former CM Okram Ibobi Singh said he too would meet Governor Najma Heptulla for Friday.  Bihar Opposition Leader and former deputy CM   also talked about meeting Governor SP Malik. He also called for Opposition leaders from across the country to go and campaign in Karnataka capital Bengaluru. The Congress and the RJD did not stand alone. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo came down heavily on the BJP:  West Bengal CM and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee threw in her support: Dravida Munnetra Khazagam leader MK Stalin also joined in: Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary   had already criticised the Karnataka move Wednesday. As did National Conference leader and former Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah: On the other hand, the few major allies that the BJP are left with – the People's Democratic Party, the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party – did not come out in any major way to back the saffron party. Realistically perhaps the Congress and the RJD do not stand much of a chance even if they get appointments with the state governors: An elected governmet can only be brought down on the floor of the House. But the grandstanding in the three states managed to generate a lot of political buzz which will only add to the BJP's pressure over the ongoing Karnataka imbroglio.",2018-05-18 01:34:00+05:30,," Karnataka resonates in Goa, Bihar, Manipur.

321,Rajeev Khanna,"With more or less a year to go before the General election process kicks in, Haryana's political firmament is showing signs of heating up soon. Wednesday the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) and Bahujan Samaj party ( ) drew first blood in the poll arena by annoincing an understanding. For starters, a tie-up will surely be a boost to main Opposition INLD, which is out of power for the third term now. But that won't be the be all and end all, political observers think. Dalits, BSP's core supporters, are around 21 per cent of Haryana's population. Although they have been traditionally Congress supporters, the BSP too has been able to put in place a dedicated base. By eying to garner most of the downtrodden community's support,  's party is now looking at emerging kingmaker.  Wednesday Haryana Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala (INLD) and BSP's Meghraj Singh announced the parties have joined hands in Haryana to keep the   (BJP) and the Congress out of power. Singh is in charge of BSP's affairs in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand. The two parties had come together for a short-lived alliance in 1998. It remains to be seen how they avoid the repeat of that episode, when senior-most INLD leader Om Prakash Chautala was at the helm of affairs. Abhay, Om Prakash's son, said the alliance was on certain broad contours and Mayawati would be projected as the prime ministerial candidate.  The Congress is guilty of massive corruption and the BJP has left no stone unturned to lead the country towards violent inter-community and inter-communal conflicts and polarise the society. Therefore all forces representing the downtrodden, suppressed, farming and the labouring classes must join hands to oust and keep them away from power, he said. Abhay claimed the coming together has laid the foundation for a Third Front. The two parties are determined to champion the cause of the Dalits, farmers and the working class and create a new Haryana. Meghraj too reiterated the resolve of the two parties to give a credible alternative to the nation and keep the BJP and the Congress out of power in Haryana. The issue sharing of seats in elections has been left open for the moment. Both the leaders also resolved that the BSP will lend its wholehearted support to the 'Jail Bharo' agitation being launched by the INLD from May 1. Meanwhile Meghraj said BSP’s lone legislator in Haryana Tek Chand Sharma has been suspended since party workers were dissatisfied with his functioning and he extended outside support to the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government. In the last Assembly polls, the BSP cornered 4.37 per cent votes, a 2-percentage point fall than in 2009.  The INLD and the BSP formed an alliance ahead of the 1998 Lok Sabha polls and the BSP had even managed to win the Ambala seat. The INLD won its maximum of four out of the state's 10 seats. The alliance was short lived as Om Prakash announced support for the minority BJP government at the centre under Atal Behari Vajpayee. At that time the relation between the BJP and Mayawati had hit rock bottom. In 2009, the BSP had also gone in for an alliance with Haryana Janhit Congress, led by Kuldeep Bishnoi but it broke ahead of the polls.The most scathing reaction to the news of the alliance came from BJP state chief Subhash Barala, who called it a “mismatched marriage”, harking back to 1998. “While INLD patriarch Chaudhary Devi Lal was the rallying point for the Third Front, his successors have taken the party to the pits where it is looking up to the BSP leadership for survival,” he said. “In the last Assembly polls where the INLD candidates had come a close second on 17 seats and the margin of loss was less than five per cent of the votes. It is being perceived that with a little support, they could have won and the party tally would have gone up to 38 seats.  “In such circumstances there are often chances of the party forming the government. The coming together of INLD and BSP is a first major move ahead of the forthcoming polls and many more such moves will dot the poll matrix in the days to come,” says senior political observer Balwant Takshak. Observers say that if the combination gathers steam in the months to come it would pose a major challenge to the Congress that is eying major political gains. It need to be seen how the Dalits take to supporting the INLD that is widely perceived to be a Jat political force.  During the Jat agitation of 2016, the Dalits had been at the receiving end in places like Gohana. Many things will emerge in the days to come but for now the INLD has definitely put politicking in the first gear in Haryana.",2018-04-19 16:27:00+05:30,," INLD, BSP pre-poll pact puts politics in top gear in Haryana | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

323,Anurag Dey,"The country may continue to debate about the mysterious death of BH Loya. But for the Supreme Court there was no mystery: the special CBI judge who was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case – in which   chief   was prime accused – died a natural death. A three-Judge Bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices AM Khanwilkar and DY Chandrachud, dismissed the petitions seeking an independent investigation into judge Loya’s death and warned the petitioners for abusing the process of public interest litigation (PIL) for political and financial motives. Pronouncing the eagerly awaited verdict, the bench held the petitions to be “absolutely meritless”. “PIL jurisdiction is being misused to settle political agenda. There is a great danger if this is allowed to continue. Political battles should be fought in the halls of democracy and not inside court,” said the Bench. It castigated the petitioners’ counsels for scandalising the judiciary and casting aspersions on the Administrative Committee of the Bombay High Court, but stopped short of initiating civil contempt against the petitioner. Among the counsels for the petitioners was Prashant Bhushan, who had been pivotal in a recent aborted attempt to bring impeachment motion against the CJI in Parliament.  After Thursday's verdict, Bhushan said: “It is a wrong decision, and in my view it’s a black day for Supreme Court. Despite the presence of so many doubts and suspicion, the SC instead of an independent probe put a lid on judge Loya’s death. This puts a bigger question mark about the basis on which this verdict was given and at whose insistence”. The petitions seeking a Special Investigation Team probe were filed following reports by t  magazine about Loya’s family members suspecting foul play behind his death and making shocking revelations, including a bribe offer of Rs 100 crore to a top Maharashtra judge in return for a favourable judgment in favour of Shah.  Loya died during the intervening night of 30 November and 1 December, 2014 while he was on a visit to Nagpur. Taking over the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case after his predecessor judge JT Utpat was suddenly transferred, Loya questioned Shah’s absence during the hearing of the sensational case.  Within a month of Loya’s death, Shah was discharged by the CBI court.  Curiously, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which had indicted Shah of being a “part of the larger conspiracy to kill Sohrabuddin, subsequently his wife Kauser Bi and and finally Tulsiram Prajapati, did not challenge Shah’s discharge. In the aftermath of   reports, the Maharashtra government ordered a “discreet enquiry” in the case. In it, the four judicial officers who accompanied Loya to the hospital after he complained of chest pain had denied any foul play in their statements. The CJI Bench, while dismissing the petitions, said there was no reason to “disbelieve the sequence of events leading to the death as narrated by the four judicial officers”. During the hearings there were also   particularly Dushyant Dave, who represented one of the petitioners, and Harish Salve representing the Maharashtra.The Loya case was also the centre to the unprecedented media conference by top SC judges Jasti Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan Lokur and Kurien Joseph. The four senior-most judges have accused the CJI of assigning importance cases that included the Loya case, “selectively to the Benches of their preference”. The verdict has led to a political slugfest. Welcoming the verdict, the BJP said it was a slap on the face of Congress President  , who were trying to politicise the judiciary. “Congress’ conspiracy lies exposed and its attempt to score political point has failed. The people who have been politicising the judiciary for their own motives, now stand exposed,” said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. Meanwhile Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the verdict will raise more questions. “You (court) have spoken about lawyers and their personal problems that is not the issue. The issue is the lacunae in the enquiry (into Loya’s death), that has not been addressed,” said Congress leader Tehseen Poonawalla, one of the petitioners. In a series of tweets he also punched holes in the verdict.   Another Congress leader and former Union minister Salman Khurshid said: “Many, many people will be deeply disappointed. The SC view has to be accepted and respected but what was hoped that the SC would go deeper into the affairs, something which is extremely, extremely controversial”.  Veteran legal practitioner Majeed Memon, a Rajya Sabha member from Nationalist Congress Party, said: “Please examine the background in which this matter was heard and disposed off by this Bench. With the highest respect to it, if there was some kind of suspicion, some kind of disbelief in the minds of people that they will not get justice from a particular Bench, then the Bench ought to have recused. If he died a natural death and there is nothing suspicious about it, then what was the problem in having a probe? Whatever the political stands be, it looked unlikely that Thursday's verdict will put the matter to rest.",2018-04-19 13:46:00+05:30,, No mystery in Judge Loya’s 'mystery death': SC dismisses probe pleas  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
324,Charu Kartikeya,"A divided Opposition finally put its indecision behind and sought the impeachment of Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra. The timing of the move, however, will be a big impediment in its success. Leaders from Indidan National Congress and six other opposition parties met Rajya Sabha Chairman   Friday morning to seek an impeachment motion against him. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal told reporters that in the motion, five charges of “misbehaviour” have been levelled against the CJI. Three of these charges are connected with the medical college bribery scam, in which officials of Prasad Education Trust allegedly planned to bribe senior functionaries of the Supreme Court as well as the Allahabad High Court to secure “ ”.  The fourth charge relates to the CJI “having acquired land when he was an Advocate by giving an affidavit that was later found to be false”. It has also been alleged that Misra didn't surrender this land until his elevation to the apex court in 2012, despite the allotment having been cancelled in 1985. The final charge is about “abuse of exercise of power” by the CJI by “choosing to send” sensitive matters to particular benches only.The Opposition first mooted the impeachment proposal in January after the   by the CJI's four brother judges, Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph. However, there was no unanimity over the proposal among not just the larger opposition but even within Congress. In fact, some reports suggested that no less than former prime minister   was opposed to the proposal.  Eventually, Leader of the Congress party in Lok Sabha,   earlier this month that the issue was closed now. The sudden revival of the impeachment campaign has created the impression that it has been prompted by the Supreme Court's rejection of the appeal for ordering a probe behind the death of CBI special judge BH Loya.  Sibal and Azad dismissed this contention and said they had approached Naidu's office for an appointment about a week ago. Azad added that the signatures of 70 MPs had been collected when the Parliament was still in session. Six of them have now retired. However, it will be hard for the Congress to dispel this speculation and that will mar the prospects of this campaign. When the Opposition had first picked this issue up, the presser by the judges had already created an impression that something was amiss in the top court under Misra.  However, the three-month dilly-dallying in taking the final call has cost the campaign dear.

326,Charu Kartikeya,"The process of rebellion that Yashwant Sinha triggered months ago met its natural conclusion Saturday. The former finance minister announced that he has severed all relations with BJP, the party that was his home for over two decades. “The future of democracy” is in danger, Sinha said while making the announcement, at an event in Patna. The event was the first gathering of a platform created by Sinha and a few other leaders about a year ago, named Rashtra Manch. Saying he was sad at the erosion of democratic institutions in the country, Sinha announced he wasn't just quitting the BJP but was giving up party politics forever. Vowing to never join any political party from now on, he also pledged to launch a massive movement to save democracy. Many will be compelled to say that this will hardly have any impact on the BJP's electoral prospects because Sinha appears to have become a spent force. He has not been fighting elections and has been sidelined inside his party for a long time. However, his action needs to be looked at from the prism of what it says about how BJP has changed from his glory days in the party to now. It must be remembered that Sinha is not from RSS ranks and was a case of lateral entry into BJP. He rose in stature in spite of that and was eventually appointed national vice-president, apart from Finance Minister and External Affairs Minister.  However, the rise of   and   proved to be disastrous for him and two other party veterans, LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi. Along with Jaswant Singh, these three leaders occupied top positions in the party and the government when the BJP first came to power under former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee. In the year when Modi became PM, Vajpayee, Advani and Joshi were dropped from the party's parliamentary board and relegated to a newly constituted body called 'Margdarshak Mandal', essentially a toothless old age home of sorts. Sinha didn't find a place even there. Non-allegiance to RSS is what distinguishes him from Advani and Joshi and it is this difference that explains the difference in their approaches. Advani and Joshi have quietly receded into the background, largely surrendering to the total grasp of Modi and Shah on the party. Sinha, however, refused to lay low, in spite of the fact that his son is a sitting BJP MP and a minister in the Modi government. Sinha is also not an Advani loyalist, a qualification that is said to have marred the prospects of several leaders in the party who were at the top echelons before the ascent of Shah and Modi on the national scene. In fact, Sinha was the first among the party's top leaders to push for the selection of Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, way back in January 2013. There is little doubt that his rebellion is primarily against Modi and Shah and then everybody else who is seen to be doing their bidding. This rebellion, therefore, means that somebody who was rooting for Modi to be made the prime ministerial candidate five years ago is now not just disappointed in Modi, but is angry with him. This should be fodder enough for others in the party to ruminate over, with elections just around the corner.",2018-04-23 16:47:00+05:30,, Yashwant has come a long way from rooting for Modi as PM to seeing him as threat for democracy | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
327,Akash Bisht,"A mid-air scare after his plane developed a technical snag has forced Congress president   to vow to undertake the arduous Kailash Mansarovar trek after the Karnataka elections. Speaking to party workers and leaders while launching the Jan Aakrosh Rally in Delhi, the Congress president said that once he feared that his plane is going to crash, he thought of visiting Kailash Mansarovar. The self-claimed 'Shiv Bhakt' will now travel to the mountain that is the mythical abode of Hindu deity Shiva, which many see as yet another attempt by the Congress president of indulging in soft Hindutva politics before the crucial assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh to counter the  's aggressive Hindutva agenda in these states. Earlier, Rahul had embarked on several visits to temples in the run-up to Assembly elections in Gujarat, which political pundits believed did help the Congress in putting up a brave fight against the BJP in Prime Minister  's home state. After its improved performance in Gujarat, Rahul adopted a similar strategy in Karnataka where he was seen visiting multiple temples and mutts in what many think was yet another attempt at playing the soft hindutva card to woo the majority community voters to its fold in this do or die battle. With only 11 days left before the southern state goes to polls, it still remains a mystery whether the gamble to woo the voters with temple runs have succeeded in giving the party an edge over its saffron rivals. Experts believe that unlike Gujarat, there has been negligible impact of his visits to temples with some even questioning Rahul being a factor in the upcoming polls. “It is having no impact whatsoever because voters are well aware that Congress is more secular compared with the BJP. Congress has had a long history, starting with Nehru's idea of secularism and people are aware of Congress' Nehruvian cultural practices.   did say that we are victims of appeasement, which is leading to identity markers becoming problems for political parties. It does not bode well for our democracy,” said Prof Muzzaffar Assadi, who teaches Political Science at Mysuru University. According to him, Rahul's visit to temples and mutts in just ritual symbolism and should not be mistaken with soft hindutva. “Ritual symbolism doesn't carry the meaning of hate or communalism which soft Hindutva to an extent does. There is a consensus amongst voters in Karnataka that Congress is trying to woo them through ritual symbolism and not soft Hindutva. Soft Hindutva must have worked in Gujarat but no one in Karnataka bothers about it,” he added. He also thinks that even if the Congress may want to transform, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will not. He would continue to carry forward the legacy of secularism. Assadi added, “He symbolises liberalism, intellectualism and secularism and the main fight in the state is between Siddaramaiah's subaltern model and BJP's divisive agenda.” Meanwhile, Professor Narendar Pani, who teaches Political Science at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru, disagreed with Congress indulging in soft Hindutva politics in the state. According to him, former Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi often visited temples and mutts in the state and that there is nothing new to what Rahul is doing. “It's only the media that is labelling such visits as soft Hindutva. These visits are nothing but reactions to Congress being portrayed as an anti-Hindu party. Soft Hindutva has no role in Karnataka and elections are being fought on local issues. I don't know whether Rahul is even a factor in these elections,” Pani pointed. According to him, the logic of it working in Gujarat cannot be applied here in Karnataka. “The same brush can't be used for every state. It might have worked in Gujarat but not in Karnataka,” Pani said while pointing that Rahul has also visited several dargahs in the state and no one seems to be bringing that up. When asked that dargahs are known to attract people of all faiths unlike mosques, Pani countered, “If we use that logic than mutts are also not temples.” Interestingly, a Congress leader from the state concurred that these temple visits seem to have created a negative impact on some of the party's traditional voters. Speaking on the request of anonymity, he said, “We were Hindu earlier as well so why this need to prove that we are more Hindu now. This is making some traditional voters angry because they are asking: Were they not Hindus when they won in the past? Why do you have to prove that you are a Hindu now. Visiting temples and mutts has been there for ages in the Gandhi family,” he said. According to him, the party has fallen in the trap laid out by the BJP, which has succeeded in saying that Gandhis are not Hindus. “We are all Hindus so where does the question even arrive? Only that will help us in winning elections would be a pro-poor image. They should realise that they can't fight BJP on the Hindutva plank,” he added. Citing victories of 2004 and 2009, he asked, “We never visited any temples or mosques back then and still won. We lost in 2014 because our leaders had become corrupt and lost connect with the workers. Now, these seniors want to put all blame on Rahul by saying that you were indulging in appeasement and it can only be undone by visit to temples. If they thought visiting temples would help them win, why didn't they do it themselves.” Amid all this, there are also talks of Muslims feeling alienated by Congress' move of playing the soft Hindutva card and could possibly support another party. Assadi dismissed such claims and asserted that Muslims, who form 18% of the population, feel that the BJP remain their No 1 enemy. “They have this fear that if BJP wins yet another term at the state and the Center, their personal and physical security is at stake. In Karnataka, the perception is that if BJP comes to power, it could be the end of their community's freedom, cultural practices, among others. Such fear psychosis has been created in the state. BJP is seen more as a monster than a political entity,” Assadi added. Even Congress leader echoes similar views and said that the community will vote for the Congress en-masse. According to him, once Modi begins his visit to the state, the bond between Congress and Muslims would strengthen further. As far as the   (Secular) is concerned, Assadi believes that Muslims won't prefer them over Congress because of them being a “non-dependable and non-trustworthy ally”. He said, “Post-Babri Masjid demolition, Muslims felt uncomfortable under the Congress government and went on to support the likes of  , Bahujan Samaj Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal etc, which led to marginalisation of the party in the north. However, we never had any communal riots because we are a much tolerant society. That is the reason why such marginalisation of Congress did not happen here. This time around Muslims realise that if the BJP has to be kept out at power at both the Centre and state, they need to back the Congress.”",2018-04-30 22:12:00+05:30,, Kailash and temple run: Does Congress need soft Hindutva and will that work | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
328,Rajeev Khanna,"For some time now, people in Punjab are perplexed over the issue of Khalistan and extremism raising its head again and again. Only last week Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh brought it up while meeting Union Home Minister  . Also, representatives of Indus Canada Foundation gave a much more serious dimension to it. Observers have been underlining for quite sometime that the militant movement for Khalistan in Indian Punjab is dead. The idea is alive, though 'marginally', off shore where Khalistani sympathisers keep on organising events and seminars to discuss it at various platforms. One thing that marked the run up to the last year's Punjab Assembly elections is the fact that the discourse over the issue came alive amid allegations and counter allegations of hobnobbing with hardline Sikh elements. It was thought that these were just poll pranks being played by the three main players – the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)-  (BJP) combine. But the issue has remained an integral part of Punjab politics ever since with it being played up time and again by none other than the state government. Last Thursday Amarinder urged Rajnath for a comprehensive strategy to tackle the re-emergence of extremism in Punjab, which according to him, is threatening to disturb the peace and stability of the state again. The Punab CM stressed upon the need for the formulation of an all-encompassing strategy to counter emerging extremism and suggested strengthening the intelligence apparatus along with action against foreign handlers based in Canada, United Kingdom, the United States, Italy and Germany who are actively engaged in activities for revival of terrorism in Punjab. Amarinder also underlined the need for countering social media activities aimed at disturbing the peace and stability of the state. He was of the opinion that strengthening the state government’s 'Connect with Your Roots’ programme would help. A Punjab government spokesperson said Rajnath agreed to look into the state’s demands under the Modernisation of Police Forces Scheme (MPF Scheme). Citing the state’s security concerns, Amarinder had reiterated the demand for central assistance in the modernisation of the police forces. He said under MPF, Punjab should be designated a 'Category-A' state for financial assistance with 90:10 centre-state sharing basis on the pattern of Jammu and Kashmir and the eight north-eastern states. He also sought allocation of additional funds to Punjab under the MPF Scheme for strengthening the state's Special Branch for various law-and-order challenges like proxy war, trans-border terrorism and influx of drugs, weapons and explosives. A home ministry spokesperson said Amarinder apprised Rajnath about the situation in Punjab, including issues related to attempts to create disturbances through targeted killings. A number of such killings have taken place over the last one-and-a-half years. Rajnath assured all possible central assistance, as requested by the Punjab government. Amarinder appreciated support being provided by central agencies in investigating these cases. The NIA is carrying out probes into these killings, suspected to be carried out through a criminal conspiracy to disturb communal harmony in the State. On Wednesday Vikram JS Bajwa of Indus Canada Foundation while talking about various NRI issues said the students going abroad for studies, particularly to Canada and the US have been falling in the Khalistani traps.  He said majority of the students going to Canada, their number reaching around 25,000 per quarter, are being sent by their family members after selling off land or other assets. They face financial hardships there or paying their and funding their academics. Thus they are easy prey for Khalistani groups who are fronts of the Pakistani agency ISI.  “The problem is that most of these students just matriculates and are not pursuing professional courses but regular courses. They also face problems in getting jobs. The Khalistani lobbyists are luring them for anti-Punjab and anti-India training,” Bajwa said. He said his organisation has authenticated this to the Punjab Police chief Suresh Arora. He said there is no village-level record available with the government of the students going abroad. In addition to this the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has no programme to help such students in distress abroad.  He further explained that a large number of students become parts of gangs in Canada and the US that are being run by Khalistani elements. Bajwa claimed that once they get involved in any legal matter they are assured of a long stay there because the local laws do not allow their departure before the said cases are taken to their logical conclusion. He however did not come out with specific instances but claimed that there are around 600 such students on the West Coast of Canada and around 1,000 on the East Coast. This is a new dimension to the issue and can have far reaching ramifications. The manner in which both the Centre and the Amarinder regime 'cold-shouldered' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his recent visit and how the lobby adamant on raising the Khalistan bogey was successful in its attempts is well known. But what is baffling a large number of Punjabis is that why is Amarinder singing to a tune that is generally perceived to that of the BJP under the leadership of people like Prime Minister   and the party's National President  . There is a strong point of view that Amarinder has been trying to carve out a niche for himself in the 'nationalist politics' that is the flavour of the politics in India since Modi came to power. But a more precise view comes from Dal Khalsa leader Kanwar Pal Singh who said: “The whole issue is about polarising voters along communal lines in Punjab ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress knows that the Sikh vote will be split between the Akalis and them. It wants to consolidate the Hindu vote in its favour by raising the issue of Khalistan again and again.”  The Hindu vote bank had shifted towards the Congress during the assembly polls because of various factors like the AAP leadership being seen close to the Sikh hardliners in Canada, impact of demonetisation on small traders etc. Kanwar Pal Singh further said: “Sikh chief ministers, whether from the Congress or the Akalis, have proved to be the best friends of the centre. They have always contained the anti-Centre sentiment. The Centre has always saddled them with the task of keeping at bay the issues related to separate identity, homeland etc.” There is a wide perception among political observers in Punjab among the non BJP chief ministers in the country, Amarinder is the one who has been echoing BJP's line on such issues to a large extent. Many observers feel that having failed to deliver what he had promised in the run up to the elections, Amarinder has been trying to divert attention by raising the issue of Khalistan.  Whatever the case Amarinder will have to come out with an explanation to debunk all these perceptions to clear the political mist around Khalistan that is once again engulfing Punjab.",2018-05-01 15:32:00+05:30,, Why Khalistan keeps raising its head in Punjab's political narrative | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

Bhutia said he would focus on corruption and unemployment in his home state in theh run-up to next year's Sikkim Assembly elections. “Corruption, unemployment, high suicide rates, youngsters getting into drugs/alcohol and lack of leadership in the state are some of the key issues for me,” Bhutia said. He slammed the current Pawan Chamling-led Sikkim Democratic Front government for approving numerous hydroelectric power projects. “Sikkim has a fragile environment. What is the need to have 29-30 hydel projects? Despite having so many power projects, uninterrupted power supply has still not reached a large part of the state,” he said.  “And while we vouch for organic farming, agricultural lands are being taken away by pharmaceutical companies. We need development, but a sustainable one. Even today, a tarred road has not reached my village,” he added. Alleging corruption under Chamling, Bhutia said the ban on the entry of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the state must be lifted. “If they are clean, they need to prove it,” the football ace said. There has been speculation about Bhutia's political future after he fell out with Trinamool. Some quarters guessed he would join the   (BJP), th party against which he unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Darjeeling and the Siliguri Assembly constituency in 2016. He was always considered an outsider in Trinamool, Bhutia alleged at the launch. He said he did not agree with the party’s stand on Gorkhaland. “I believe that the people of Darjeeling must have an option to not remain in West Bengal,” he added. Bhutia said the formal launch of his party in Sikkim will be in a few weeks, and it will aim to pose a challenge to five-times CM Chamling.  The party president and the CM candidate will be named soon. “This is not my party. This is a party of the people of Sikkim.

332,Akash Bisht,"Ending long-standing speculation over who would lead the Congress in Madhya Pradesh in the run-up to the 2018 Assembly elections, the party Thursday announced senior leader Kamal Nath as its state unit president. He replaced former Union minister Arun Yadav. The appointment of the nine-time member of Parliament from Chindwara was done with the intent to put an end to factionalism within the state unit, which was considered to be among one of the primary reasons for Congress' disastrous performance in the state. Congress also carefully made other crucial appointments to ensure different factions were equally represented in the party's state unit. Congress' chief whip in Lok Sabha and Guna MP, Jyotiraditya Scindia, has been made the chairman of the campaign committee. While many are considering Nath's elevation as a setback for Scindia, political experts believe that being the campaign committee chief gives the Guna MP opportunity to be a constant feature in party's election campaign, which could see him interact with people across the state and build support for himself. According to experts, Nath's appointment in no way suggests that he could also be the party's chief ministerial candidate. Though he is certainly being considered as the front-runner for the post if the party manages to oust the   (BJP). Ever since the Congress won the recently held assembly bye-elections in Mungaoli and Kolaras, there was a buzz that Scindia could be handed the reigns of the party. In fact, even Nath backed Scindia's name for the state chief. However, all this while, former chief minister Digvijay Singh was busy with his Narmada parikrama and on his return, sources claimed that he put his weight behind Nath, whom he fondly addresses as “elder brother”. This many believe made the Congress rethink on Scindia's candidature in order to avoid any more factionalism. Sources claim that on his return, Singh seemed to have made it clear to the central leadership that he was more comfortable with Nath at the helm of affairs instead of Scindia. Other reasons being attributed to Chhindwara MP making the cut are his deep pockets and organisational skills. Despite being considered an outsider in state politics, Nath's “connections” across the spectrum have made the Congress president rethink on his promise of giving youngsters more opportunities. “On the other hand, Kamal Nath, unlike his buddy 'Diggy Raja', has rarely been spotted in Bhopal. He is seen as an 'outsider' and his influence is limited to 30-40 seats in the southern belt,” wrote Bhavdeep Kang in Firstpost. It is for his “delegating and outsourcing” skills that many believe helped him get the job. “Unlike Scindia, who will have to do all the running now, considering he is the campaign chief, Nath is most likely to sit in his office and delegate work. This isn't necessarily bad for Scindia who will get an opportunity to improve his presence and popularity in the state,” said Harish Divekar, a Bhopal-based political analyst. In fact, sources have informed that Congress President   had a meeting with the three leaders – Nath, Singh and Scindia – where they all asked for a change of guard in the state. In fact, one of the senior-most leaders of MP had confided in this reporter that it was crucial for the Congress to declare a name to ensure that the party stands behind him as it looks to end the 15-year-old rule of the Shivraj Singh Chauhan. “The party workers are in a state of confusion and a decision needs to be taken soon to ensure that we stand behind whoever is chosen by the central leadership. If a decision is not taken soon, we will be in a disadvantageous position,” he had said. Meanwhile, senior state leader Mahendra Joshi welcomed the decision and said Nath was given the charge because of his seniority. He even welcomed party's decision to appoint Scindia as campaign committee chief and said, “The experience and acceptability of Nath and energy of Scindia will invigorate and unite the party. With these appointments, every aspect has been taken care of and as a result the Congress will emerge as a very strong team which will end BJP's misrule in the state,” he said. Along with these two appointments, Congress has also announced the names of four working presidents who hail from different regions and caste groups. Bala Bachhan, Ramnivas Rawat, Jitu Patwari and Surender Choudhary have been appointed as new working presidents of the state unit. Interestingly, the party has accommodated these four on the basis of which camp they belong to. Rawat, from Other Backward Classes, is considered particularly close to Scindia while Patwari, also an OBC, is close to Singh. The other two – Bachhan (Scheduled Tribe) and Choudhary (Scheduled Caste) – are Nath's loyalists. Experts have pointed how the party has not given any representation to either the Thakurs or the Brahmins in these positions. However, they believe that apart from the big three, these four represent different caste groups and regions which should benefit the party in taking on the BJP. “In fact, with these appointments, the Congress has created a perfect mix of region and caste which should help it in the run up to the polls. With these changes, Congress has ensured a close contest with the BJP,” said Divekar. He informed that Patwari comes from Malwa region while Chaudhary, Bachhan and Rawat come from Bundelkhand, Nimar and Chambal regions respectively. According to 2011 census, the state's total population is 7.26 crore, out of which OBC's constitute 51% of the population while SCs constitute 15.51% and STs 21.1%. Overall, 87% people of the state belong to SC, ST and backward classes, which makes these appointments even more crucial.",2018-04-26 19:11:00+05:30,, Kamal Nath to lead Congress in Madhya Pradesh.

333,Sulagna Sengupta,"Controversies regarding Panchayat elections in West Bengal continued even as the state election commission Thursday announced that polling will now be held on 14 May in a single phase, instead of the three phases it originally sought. This has led to accusations of the SEC bending over backwards to accommodate the Mamata Banerjee-led government's wish, after much dilly-dallying, deliberations and a legal battle. In fact, Opposition parties might even move court to prevent the single-phase election, which they apprehend would lead to bloodshed. There are fewer police personnel per booths when the entire force needs to be deployed for elections; also police statiosn would not have officers, Opposition parties said. They claimed during filing of nominations many party workers were killed and many could not file. Some commission officials admitted to a shortage of secuity arrangement: there will be only 43,000 armed police and 58,000 other police personnel for 43,067 polling booths and 58,467 polling premises. The poll panel has already informed this to the state government. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee though welcomed the move and urged all parties to keep away from 'false political campaigns'. ""I want elections to be held peacefully. I have alreday ordered the police administartion to coordinate with SEC and seal the borders."" she added. Raising the issue of less then enough security cover, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Biman Bose alleged that the election has been turned into a farce and the commission has become a puppet in the hands of the state government. Commission officials, claiming to be in consultation with the government, indicated that forces from other states may become necessary. “We are co-ordinating with the state government and discussing security arrangements. Each district will have an observer and for every two blocks there will be an officers. Deployment may vary with topography,” Commission Secretary Nilanjan Shandilya said. State BJP President Dilip Ghosh said “We will meet the state election commissioner Friday and ask him about security arrangements.

334,Charu Kartikeya,"It is not for nothing that the appointment of Kamal Nath as chief of  's Madhya Pradesh unit has come as a surprise for many. Nath is 71, has never helmed the party's affairs in the state in any position and had himself endorsed the name of Jyotiradiya Scindia for the party's chief ministerial candidate last September. The return of former MP chief minister Digvijay Singh from his Narmada pilgrimage, however, seems to have changed the situation drastically. It has been widely reported that Singh lent his weight behind Nath, telling the party high command that he would prefer the member of Parliament froom to Scindia. Bang came the announcement: Nath appointed president. Scindia was also given a key charge – head of the campaign committee for the upcoming Assembly elections. In yet another surprise, four working presidents were also appointed, two of them said to be bearing allegiance to Singh. Essentially, in one stroke, all three warring factions of the Congress in MP were accommodated. The objective, so far, is clear – unite squabbling leaders and make all of them work for one goal: defeat three-time CM,  . Ahead of the Gujarat Assembly elections also, the party had appointed four working presidents for the state to simultaneously reach out to Dalits, other backward classes, Patels and tribals. However, the PCC chief wasn't changed and Bharat Singh Solanki was asked to continue. No CM face was announced. The strategy could be considered a relative success as the party bettered its performance. The  , in fact, came very close to defeat. It was different in Punjab, where former CM Amarinder Singh was formally designated as the choice for the CM's post. Singh was highly confident of his victory and convinced high command to give him complete charge. He was already serving as PCC chief. The Punjab game-plan was entirely successful and Singh brought the state to the Congress again. Congress President   would be hoping that Kamal Nath will achieve the same feat in MP, helped by rival camps led by Digvijay Singh and Jyotiraditya Scindia. There are rumblings in the state that Nath has also been given the charge as he is the one most likely to bring much-needed funds for the campaign. He declared assets worth over Rs 200 crore in his affidavit filed before the Election Commission in 2014. With a 76-year old CM in Punjab and a 71-year old PCC chief in MP, many feel that Gandhi's original strategy of phasing out the old guard has been turned on its head. However, Gandhi himself had indicated this shift in his speech at the party's plenary last month.  “If the youth have to take the Congress forward, it cannot be done without the experience of the party veterans. My task is to be take them together,” he said at the outset. In MP, with the old guard firmly back in the driver's seat, it remains to be seen how much would the strategy work. Even if it results in taking the tally up for the party, it may impact formulation of the game plan for the big battle, the next Lok Sabha polls.",2018-04-28 15:26:00+05:30,," Kamal Nath's appointment may seem strange, but matches the turn Congress has been taking | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/
335,Akash Bisht,"A new challenge has cropped up for the   in Punjab: several legislators from scheduled castes as well as other backward classes have indicated a rebellion against Chief Minister Amarinder Singh for not being adequately represented in his Cabinet.  Trouble began after Singh expanded his Cabinet but did not accommodate any of these 10 members of the Legislative Assembly. Several Dalit MLAs alleged that he preferred loyalists at the cost of merit and seniority. They highlighted that Jat Sikhs, who constitute 25% of the state's population, secured eight ministries but SCs, with 32.5% population, got only three. Backward classes (19%) were not allotted a single portfolio. “We met at Punjab Technical Education Minister Charanjit Singh Channi's house Tuesday where we raised these issues. It was decided that we will write to the CM and await his response,” a Dalit MLA told Catch. He added that earlier they visited Delhi to raise the issue with Congress President  , who asked them to wait: “We have been assured by Rahul and we take his word seriously. However, we think that the chief minister is not serious about it and it is for this reason that we have decided to raise this again and again till some action is taken.” In fact, other legislators have also met Rahul and raised their concerns over the issue but that has not helped their cause. Another MLA, who was part of the delegation that met Rahul, said how they would not take any extreme step since that would destabilise the government and not bode well for the party in the upcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. “We are not here to break the party but we want to remind the chief minister that we are also part of this party and should not be ignored like this. If he wants to keep his loyalists happy that is fine but he should also think about us and the communities we represent. If they don't think about that, the party might lose support of Dalit voters in the Lok Sabha elections,” said another legislator. At the meeting at Channi's place the MLAs also discussed how the government waived off loans of prosperous Jat Sikh farmers but ignored the poorer ones, particularly agricultural labourers, also Dalits. “If you can waive off loans worth Rs 2 lakh of prosperous farmers, you should also think about these poor farmers who would be content with even Rs 20,000,” another MLA said. Among a total 31 legislators from the communities only three are in the Cabinet of 18. The rebellion was triggered by the Amarinder government's decision to nominate only five Dalits for the 125 posts of law officers. Shamsher Singh Dullo, who represents the Grand Old Party in Rajya Sabha and is a Dalit, claimed the community has been denied its share since Independence. “For 70 years, we have failed to ensure representation of Dalits in jobs, forget ministries. Even now they are not allowed to enter temples or gurudwaras. I just want the Punjab government and the chief minister to fulfill the promises made to people in its manifesto,” he said. He also alleged that a scam was in the making in the state regarding scholarships to backward caste students. “Children are not getting scholarships, forcing them to discontinue studies. The Punjab government has not been issuing SC certificates to many such students. I have raised it with the SC/ST Commission, which has promised to look into it,” he added. Boasting the highest density of Dalit population among states, these developments in Punjab don't bode well for the party that have constantly being attacking the   government over Dalit issues. With Punjab being the only Congress-ruled state that has such a sizeable population of Dalits, a rebellion of this sort would certainly put the party on the back foot before it approaches crucial elections in several states where caste plays a major factor.",2018-05-03 09:04:00+05:30,, Punjab Congress faces rebellion over lack of representation for Dalits | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
336,Rajeev Khanna,"Politics in Punjab is on the boil again. This time the issue pertains to the alleged dilution of Sikh history in the school textbooks for Classes 11 and 12. The issue is all set to gather steam in the days to come given its emotive nature. One must keep in mind the distinct character of Punjab when it comes to such issues, no matter how big or small they are. This is a border state where a national minority is in majority. It is a state that has witnessed a lot of turmoil over issues of Sikh identity and homeland and these issues still form a part of political narrative. The political battle began with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) firing the first salvo and former education minister Dr Daljit Singh Cheema accusing the state's own school board of expunging the history makers of Punjab from the history books. He said the move could be part of a deep rooted conspiracy to rob the future generations of Punjabis from knowledge about the history of Sikh Gurus and Sikh warriors of Punjab. He said there were 23 chapters carrying information about Sikh Gurus, Sikh warriors and historical facts about Punjab in the class twelve history book that have been removed illogically and replaced with a half page description about the glorious period of Sikh history. “This is intolerable as it amounts to playing with the sentiments of the Sikh community and purposefully ignoring the contributions of the Sikh gurus in the history of the country,” he said while pointing that the new book has also done injustice to Punjabis by ignoring their stellar role in the freedom struggle as well as their contributions to safeguard the unity and integrity of the country. The main Opposition party, the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) too joined the issue with its leadership collectively pointing that the move of Punjab State Education Board (PSEB) to remove the chapters related to the history of Sikh gurus and their teachings, Anglo-Sikh wars, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, the rule of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Sikh struggle against Mughals and Ahmad Shah Abdali and the origin and growth of Sikh Misls etc will isolate the youth of Punjab from glorious past of Sikhism in particular and Punjab as a whole. Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh was quick to dismiss these 'malicious' allegations and claimed that courses had merely been realigned with the National Council of Education Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus to enable the students from Punjab to compete at the national level. He claimed that the history chapters had been now spread across Classes XI and XII, on the recommendation of an expert committee, of which a Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) representative was also a member. He further claimed that far from removing any chapter on the Sikh Gurus, the Board, under his directives, had in fact incorporated chapters on the lives of the four Sahibzadas in the school text books to ensure that the youngsters also learn of their sacrifices, along with the history of the Sikh Gurus. He later pointed that the decision to realign the courses with NCERT syllabus was taken during the Akali regime in 2014. Taking the battle to the next level the Akalis have given an ultimatum to the government to immediately issue orders to stop 'the conspiracy to eliminate the proud and unparalleled history and heritage of the Khalsa Panth or face a worldwide popular resistance movement by the Sikh quom'. They along with their ally   (BJP) have decided to seek the Governor VP Singh Badnore's intervention in the matter. SAD President Sukhbir Singh Badal has convened an emergency meeting of the political affairs committee, the working committee, the general council, all the political advisers, all the zila and circle jathedars of the party Amritsar on May 11. To make matters worse, historians are also pointing at factual errors in the new books with regards to dates, references to historical figures and incorrect usage of words while referring to several aspects of Sikhism. Admitting to the mistakes, the government has apologised and promised to make necessary corrections after a review. Reports say that as many as 45,700 copies of the book have already been printed in Hindi, Punjabi and English mediums. Observers point out that this is the first issue on which a major confrontation between the Congress and Akalis appears imminent. Till now the Amarinder government has been facing flak for going soft on Akalis on various other issues. It is being questioned what was the need to change the syllabus knowing very well that this is a touchy issue. The additions were welcome but dilution of already existing content would obviously create unrest in a state like Punjab and that too in a syllabus of a subject like history for classes 11 and 12 where it is an optional subject and not a compulsory one. The government needs to tell who finalized the syllabus and when as the printing of books followed later. The issue is an emotive one that has fallen in the lap of the Akalis. It has all the potential to snowball into a major one at a time when Punjab prepares for the Shahkot Assembly by-poll scheduled for May 28 that will be followed by Lok Sabha polls in less than a year.",2018-05-04 19:20:00+05:30,, Punjab politics on the boil over 'dilution' of Sikh history in textbooks | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
337,Rajeev Khanna,"Along with the summer temperature, politics in Haryana too has started soaring. With the wheat harvest over and barely a year to go for both the Lok Sabha and state Assembly elections, key political parties have started shifting gears. Their leaderships are announcing political programmes one after the other. After the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) drew first blood recently by announcing a pre poll alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party ( ), the remaining two political forces – the   (BJP) and the Congress too have made their political moves by initiating programmes. The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) which has been a rank outsider till now is also making noises aiming to draw its pound of flesh in the forthcoming electoral battle. The Congress has been the most active in the state albeit in a divided manner. This remains the key concern for its supporters who have been pointing out that the people at this point of time are in favour of the Congress but the divided leadership may squander away the window of opportunity that has emerged. Former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda who remains the most powerful Congress leader in the state has announced a 'Jan Kranti Yatra' from Panipat 3 June onwards. He plans to cover every constituency under this Yatra in the days to come, raising issues pertaining to farmers, poor, labourers and the youth. He had earlier decided to start this Yatra in February but had to postpone it following a fracture that he had sustained immediately after its launch from Hodal. Hooda has been gunning for both the ruling BJP government under Manohar Lal Khattar as well as the INLD leadership. Responding to the INLD-BSP pre poll pact he said, “The pact will break before the polls like it had in 1998. What can one say about the INLD that has been entering into pacts with BJP, BSP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) one after the other.” He has been scathing in his attacks on the BJP questioning the performance of the government both in the state as well as in the centre on issues like job generation, addressing concerns of the farmers, repeated failures on the law and order front and its reliance on caste and communal polarisation for electoral benefits. Meanwhile, the state Congress chief Ashok Tanwar who heads another Congress faction has also announced his programmes that include a Dalit Mahasammelan at Karnal on May 27. It needs to be pointed that Karnal is the home turf of Khattar and Tanwar wants to score brownie points by holding the event there. Karnal and its adjoining areas have been in the news for instances of Dalit atrocities.  It is a two-pronged attack that Tanwar plans to launch in the state. While taking on the Khattar regime at the chief minister's home turf on issues pertaining to Dalits, he has also announced to undertake the second leg of his Cycle Yatra in Sirsa district which happens to be the stronghold of the INLD. This leg of the Yatra will be carried out from May 17-21 mainly covering Sirsa district that is spread over one tenth of Haryana's geographical area and is the biggest district in the state. The Yatra will also pass through Chautala village which is the home of Chautala family that is at the top of the INLD hierarchy. These initiatives will later be carried out in other districts as well in the days to come. Tanwar intends to raise issues like farm distress and demand for loan waiver, the Staff Selection Commission scam that rocked thee state recently and the effort of the government to cover up various scams including the activities of the mining mafia in the river beds and in areas adjoining the Aravalli mountain range. “We will also be taking up issues of the continuing atrocities against the officials from both the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes that have been coming to light. It has come to light that officials from these communities are not being given important posts,” he said. Not to be left behind, the BJP with Khattar as its government head is also shifting gears. Khattar has started holding road shows in various parts of the state. He has started camping in villages overnight chairing 'Gram Chaupals', breaking bread in Dalit households and promoting schemes launched by his government among the masses. He recently held two such programmes in Yamunanagar and Karnal districts. He has started showcasing the achievements of his government while conveying to the people that there is no paucity of funds in Haryana for development. He plans to soon enter the districts in the Jat heartland that are the stronghold of the Congress and the INLD. He has been interacting with rural masses to check the ground realities of the schemes launched under the ‘Gram Swaraj Abhiyan’. The ruling BJP has also reportedly drawn a road map to carry out party programmes across the state in the next two months. These are aimed at reaching out to the people and apprising them of the government programmes and achievements in the last four years.  The INLD-BSP combine have launched a 'Jail Bharo' agitation from 1 May with main focus on the the emotive issue of completion of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal on which it is targeting both the Congress and the BJP. It is also playing up the issue of water scarcity and the failures of the recent Congress and the present BJP regimes of addressing it. Its leaders have been saying that the Government of India which has been directed by the Supreme Court to complete the construction of the SYL canal has been sitting over the directive even after the final disposal of the dispute for the past eighteen months. They have been accusing the centre and the state government of conspiring against the interests of Haryana. Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Abhay Singh Chautala has stated that the central and the state governments do not seem to realise that Haryana is staring at a man-made disaster by delaying the legitimate share to it from the river waters. He reminded that even at this moment south Haryana has slipped into ‘dark zone’ in context of groundwater. “Much of the development in that region was undertaken because of the belief that the water needs of the region, both agricultural and residential, would be adequately met with the waters from rivers through SYL canal when it would reach these areas. Now that it appears that the BJP, both in New Delhi and the state, is insensitive to the needs of the people of the state, it appears that this region is on the brink of becoming barren,” he said. Even AAP is gearing to make its presence felt on the political map of the state. After an impressive rally and road show of party's national convener and Delhi chief Minister   a few weeks ago, the party is in the process of formalizing an organisational structure in the state. The party's state chief Naveen Jaihind has stated that the party leadership will be traveling across all the 90 constituencies soon. The party has also started the process of shortlisting potential candidates.

While some of these employees owe allegiance to opposition parties, some are also affiliated with the ruling Trinamool Congress. The government staff apprehend violence and are concerned about their safety as it will be them who will eventually have conduct the polling process at the ground level, whenever electiosn are held. As of now, the Calcutta High Court is yet to okay 14 May as the date of polling, proposed by the state election commission (SEC). There has been rampant violence in West Bengal during the process of filing of nominations, with all major opposition parties alleging that their candidates were forcibly kept away from filing nominations. So much so that in more than a third of seats, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's party is set to win unopposed. The widespread violence has even raised concerns about the lack of democratic space in the state and several quarters have criticised the government. Paradoxically it still enjoyed a lot of support for its scheme, according to a recent survey by a leading media house in the state otherwise critical of the government. This violence seems to have spooked the governent staff who apprehended more on polling day. “Employees are afraid to go on polling duty after violence during filing of nominations. We have urged the SEC to provide adequate security to polling personnel,” said Manoj Chakraborty, convenor of Trinamool-backed Employees Federation. He demanded that the government announces a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the family in case any staff member dies on duty. Bijay Shankar Sinha, general secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist)-backed State Co-ordination Committee of West Bengal said there were plans to meet election commissioner Amarendra Singh Thursday. “We have already sent a deputation to the commission demanding adequate security.” He underscored that that proper security cover would be necessary for around 2.5 lakh polling personnel to be deployed in around 58,467 polling stations in 20 districts. “We feel that for each polling premise there should be an armed police personnel and in the polling booth there should be at least four police officers,” he said and added that families of polling personnel were really worried.",2018-05-03 09:50:00+05:30,, Everybody is afraid of Bengal Panchayat polls.

The men and women responsible are usual suspects – radical Hindutva elements who quickly gang up to paint a fake picture of Hindu victimhood. On 26 April, police in Gurgaon arrested six people for disrupting a gathering of Muslims collectively offering namaz at a vacant plot in the city. The arrested men, identified in a video recording of the incident, were chanting 'Jai Sri Ram' and 'Radhe Radhe' while abusing the people assembled there, and asking them to stop the namaz and leave the plot (http://indianexpress.com/article/india/disruption-of-friday-namaaz-in-gurgaon-six-people-arrested-5152491/). Even as the men have now been released on bail, Hindutva activists are up in arms. Local members of Bajrang Dal, Vishwa Hindu Parishad,   and other Hindutva organisations were quick to organise themselves under the banner of an outfit that they named Sanyukt Hindu Sangharsh Samiti. That can be loosely translated into Joint Committee for Hindu Struggle. Struggle for what, may one ask? For the right to take law into one's own hands? For the power to frighten people of other faiths and tell them that they are second-class citizens? This platform has already achieved two of its objectives. The arrested men have been released on bail and the number of Muslims gathering at that plot has dropped significantly. Emboldened, the Samiti is now asking for more – quash the charges against the accused and impose a city-wide ban on reading namaz in the open. In fact, Samiti members have demanded from the state government through a letter that “Rohingyas and Bangladeshis residing in Gurgaon” should be identified and marked, “permission should not be given to read namaz in Hindu colonies” and “permission should only be given in those places where the strength of 'this' population is more than 50%”. “Otherwise”, the letter threatens, “there will continue to be a possibility of peace being obstructed.” The brazen communalism in these demands can not be overlooked. Why should Rohingyas and “Bangladeshis” be marked? Why should Muslims be obstructed from offering namaz in “Hindu colonies”? What is this awful construct that these people are referring to as “Hindu colonies”? Why can't Muslims or people of any other faith pray in the presence of Hindus? Are kirtans, jagratas and 'chowkis' held in Hindu-only colonies? Don't temples come up at the most mundane of places and are simply accepted by the community? The dangerous demands that the Samiti is making will not only encourage ghettoisation of Muslims, they will further divide the society that is already polarising at a rapid pace. Muslim-only neighbourhoods also render the residents deeply vulnerable in times of communal riots. From where are these people getting the power to make such demands so vocally? The formation of this Samiti and its phoney struggle is not too different from the way Hindutva sympathisers formed the Hindu Ekta Manch in Jammu's Kathua. The Manch was formed to express solidarity for the men charge-sheeted by Jammu police for raping and killing an 8-year old Muslim Bakkarwal girl. Members of the Manch are demanding the release of the accused and a CBI probe into the case. This Manch received open backing from a range of BJP leaders, including members of legislative assembly and ministers. While the BJP sacked two of these ministers after facing uproar, the local MLA who also backed the Manch and its demands has now been inducted into the state Cabinet. Another MLA, recently promoted to the position of deputy chief minister, has called the incident a 'minor' one. There is no ambiguity around BJP's support to the narrative that the Manch has been trying to propagate. This is the source of power for such platforms. They receive direct support from the larger Sangh Parivar because they act as foot-soldiers of its campaign. So, while the prime minister will try to get away by coining empty slogans like “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas” and citing the Quran in his speeches, foot-soldiers of the Parivar will keep carrying out such campaigns on the ground. These campaigns are designed to keep the minorities perpetually scared and they must not go unchallenged.",2018-05-01 18:19:00+05:30,, The namaz incident in Gurgaon means Jammu-style bigotry on open display | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
340,Rajeev Khanna,"Ever since   led the   to a thumping victory in the 2014 General Elections, several political parties have tried taking on the saffron party's might with varying degrees of success. Now it seems the momentum is shifting towards non-party structures. A conglomeration of progressive groups including trade unions, student bodies, farmers' associations, women's groups and Dalit organisations besides other civil society formations and non-governmental organizations have formed a collective called Jan Ekta Jan Adhikar Andolan Manch (Jejaam). Its affiliates plan mass-mobilization from May 17-22 at hyper-local levels across the country to culminate in demonstrations and rallies up to sub-divisional levels on May 23. The thrust will be to highlight unfulfilled promises made by the Modi and his party in the run-up to the previous Lok Sabha elections. The initiative in fact has adopted a slogan 'Modi ke char saal, pol khol halla bol' (Four years of Modi, get the truth out and sound the cry). The initiative follows the celebration of May Day this year as Resistance Day by Dalit organisations across the country to express resentment against the dilution of the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Jejaam activists said they have realised the need for collective action – a la trade unions – to take on the government that has behaved in a “dictatorial method denying the marginalised societies their rights achieved after sustained struggle”.  According to them, various segments of the society need to be told that their goals are interlinked and they need to come together for a common cause: Trade unions must take up issues of students; students need to support farmers; farmers should speak for workers and so on. They underlined that students, women, farmers, labourers and others come out from common families and their issues cannot be looked at separately in the light of the fact that the government has been standing with the perpetrators of violence and those who have been exploiting the common masses. “The country is witnessing an attack on the common man from all sides. If we talk about farmers, there is a policy attack on them from all sides. Every political party has been promising about implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission on agriculture but no one has come forward to do it,” said Communist Party of India's ND Ranaut at a Jejaam meeting in Solan, Himachal Pradesh. “The country has now seen some powerful movements by the farmers in states like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Punjab. They have been fired upon, but the governments had to accept their demands. The most recent example is the historic march from Nasik to Mumbai that began with 25,000 participants and gradually swelled to double that number. The government was on its knees before they even held their rally,” he added. Citing Himachal, he said: “This small district exports tomatoes worth at least Rs 70 crore; yet there is no food processing unit here, no minimum support price mechanism and no proper insurance.  NC Shandil, a senior functionary of Himachal Pradesh Transport Workers Union, pointed out that though the number of buses with the state government has doubled, the number of employees remain the same. “Those who enrolled for skill development programmes and trained in driving are being paid a paltry stipend and are being used to run the show. They work for a minimal amount in the hope of that elusive regular employment.” Attacking the National Pension Scheme he questioned why was the Modi government not getting lawmakers to first enrol for it instead before hardselling it to common workers. Jagdish Chandra Bharadwaj from All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) said steps were underway to demolish trade unions. “Once they bring about the 'fixed-term employment' trade unions would obviously become redundant. In the garb of fixed-term employment where labour is laid off after a fixed term and then others are hired the government plans to spruce up its employment figures. “There is a move to do away with Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act. People need to be told that such laws that give them some security were promulgated after long struggles,” he added. People also must know how the  , the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, and its affiliates were intruding into institutions at the smallest level. “I was a part of the initiative to set up an Employees State Insurance Specialty Hospital in the Nalagarh-Barotiwala-Baddi industrial area. Today the people at the helm of affairs include one from RSS, one from BJP and one from Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS),” he said. Representatives of youth organisations pointed out how a whole new narrative was being given by various right-wing groups to the debate on reservation in jobs and how Dalits were being vilified. They also highlighted the right-wing campaigns on recent rapes in Kathua and Unnao. “People need to be told how Dalits are being painted as villains for joblessness to cover up for the failure of the government to generate jobs. Similarly on the issue of rapes they have been saying why so much noise was made only on Kathua and Unnao rapes while rapes are being reported elsewhere also. We will tell the people that Kathua and Unnao became major movements because people from various right wing groups were defending the rapists instead of the victims,” said Ajay Bhatti, a youth leader who had also contested the last Himachal Assembly polls on youth-centric issues. Many feel that the initiatives like Jejaam are movements at the micro level that might go under reported but have a potential to counter the micro management in which Sangh Parivar has been taking a lot of pride. The activists point out that the movements at local level, particularly in semi-rural and rural areas do rattle those in power. There is also a view that these can contribute a lot in bringing together progressive political forces together in the long run, an issue that has been gaining importance over the years.",2018-05-07 21:20:00+05:30,, Mass organisations come together to count Modi's failure | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
341,Riyaz Wani,"As the Jammu and Kashmir Cabinet reshuffle brought in new ministerial faces, including new Deputy Chief Minister Kavinder Gupta, all seemed well with the coalition between   and People's Democratic Party. But Gupta struck a discordant note, terming the Kathua rape and murder “a minor incident” – displaying yet again the ideological strain between the parties that keeps betraying itself at the unlikeliest of occasions. It also gives a measure of how the tension would be like when the situation isn't going well, for example, during the deeply polarising three-month-long campaign in support of the accused in the Kathua crime. And this, at times, does push the alliance to breaking point. Only a fortnight ago, on 14 April, the ruling PDP had gone into a huddle in Srinagar, following renewed complications in its coalition with the BJP over Kathua. The saffron party's attitude was ambivalent towards the accused; some of its leaders still backing the protests in Jammu in favour of a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation, had become a source of embarrassment for the PDP in Kashmir Valley, its core constituency. The PDP was also sore about the continuing killings of the civilians in protests, seen largely as the outcome of the Centre’s iron-fist approach towards the Valley. Several PDP leaders spoke in favour of a break-up with the BJP to arrest the detrimental fallout of the alliance on the political base of the party. But in the end the party resolved to continue with the coalition after senior leaders cited the resignations of two BJP ministers – Chaudary All Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga – who had earlier participated in the rally of the Hindu Ekta Manch in favour of the accused. The coalition partners have now reconciled again, forced by the inherent dynamics of J&K politics, compulsions of their respective electoral mandates and of course the mutual convenience. The truth is that the PDP-BJP coalition has completed four years in power. The first year was under the chief ministership of the late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed – a year of relentless political tug-of-war which often pushed the state to the brink. In its second wind under  , the turmoil has been no less. After unsuccessfully trying to hold the BJP to its terms in the Agenda of Alliance during the three months of her conditional refusal to join it, Mehbooba reconciled to the state of affairs. Ever since she has, more or less, submitted to the BJP’s belligerent politics and at times ideological overreach. In the process her political stock has been declining. The BJP, backed by its government in New Delhi, has dictated the state’s policies in the past four years, and its agenda and discourse: on the Kashmir solution, a strict integrationist policy has replaced the PDP's pitch for the resolution of Kashmir, which in rhetorical terms sometimes bordered on soft separatism. The BJP has hijacked the local political discourse by ensuring that a steady stream of issues and controversies are initiated and controlled by it even on issue as indefensible as the rape and murder of the eight-year-old girl. This, in turn, has squeezed the play of not only the separatist narrative but also that of the local mainstream politics. And as for the development of the state, a prospect that had lent the PDP-BJP coalition it's biggest rationale, only around Rs 14,000 crore of the much-hyped Rs 80,000-crore package announced by Prime Minister   in November 2015 has been released in the three years since. Where does the coalition go from here? Nothing can be said with certainty. After having been together for four years and endured the consequences of their ideological divergence – albeit predominantly to the detriment of the PDP – there's no reason that it should break. More so, when there is little to gain from such a break-up. Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's political standing has plunged to an extent where it cannot even hope to claim political martyrdom. There is another problem and that is, the TINA factor. The PDP often presses it in its defence: There Is No Alternative. “Whether the coalition will last is not the right question. Whether there is a substitute in the system is,”Works Minister and J&K Government spokesman Naeem Akhtar told Catch. “We have to bear in mind the complexities of the state. Unless you give every region, every community a sense of participation and a consequent sense of empowerment, there's no other option to go about this"". When asked if the BJP’s losing the 2019 national election make a difference to the PDP’s preferences, Akhtar said the PDP was looking forward to Modi winning again. He said even if Modi were to lose the poll, it won't impact the J&K coalition. “This is a state arrangement. Truth is you can't keep one region out of the power structure. We have a mandate for six years. The mandate is such that it is region-specific for all parties. Can you afford to keep anybody out of the system?” Akhtar said. Though traditionally the electoral arithmetic arising from the demographics guaranteed the Valley its political primacy, the existing political mandate has upset the chessboard. In the last Assembly election, the majority Hindu community in Jammu voted en masse for the BJP, giving it 25 out of the province’s 37 seats, thus making the Hindu nationalist party a significant political actor in the state and a necessary part of the state’s governing structure. But in the Valley, the much-fancied PDP pulled off just 25 of the 46 seats, with others being divided up inequitably among the National Conference, Congress, People’s Conference, Awami Itihad Party and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The PDP was helped along to its final tally of 28 by its wins in three seats from the Muslim-majority areas of Jammu. Akhtar denied that the BJP was running away with the political agenda in the state. “It varies from event to event. And some things are inbuilt into the political structure of the state. You have to see it in its perspective. You can’t take it away from its historical background,” Akhtar said adding the PDP had ensured it doesn’t compromise on its own ideology and had taken steps to defend it. “There is now only one voice in the country which seeks peace with Pakistan and which is that of Mehbooba Mufti. Even liberal political voices in the country don’t ask for it”. And to the question that the BJP had yet to fulfil its commitments in the Agenda of Alliance, Akhtar agreed that the “eco-system”, which was necessary for such a fulfilment had not been created. “Kashmir is what it was pre-2003. But during Vajpayee regime, the atmosphere had changed, ecosystem had changed. There was peace. There was exchange of delegations. It was trade. It was opening of routes. That process has halted”. Despite such issues, Akhtar said the coalition will go on as there is no alternative. But with the country due to go into an election mode in a few months, Kashmir could become a hunting ground for the political parties looking for issues to rally public support in the rest of the country. And this could include attempts at polarisation too. So, the task of the PDP to hang on to the BJP might get only tougher.",2018-05-03 17:56:00+05:30,," Despite Kathua, polarisation, PDP-BJP coalition looks strong.

342,Anurag Dey,"On a day when the world celebrated Labour Day, Dalits and tribals along with Leftist leaders from across the country held demonstrations across India to make a powerful statement against the Supreme Court’s verdict that diluted Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. A collective of more than 500 Dalit and Adivasi organisations collected under the banner of 'National Coalition for Strengthening Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act' (NCSPA). They marked Tuesday as 'National Resistance Day', demanding that the   Government to either through Judicial or Parliamentary recourse, restore the status of the SC/ST Act as before the apex court’s 20 March judgment. National Resistance Day was observed in over 70 cities across 22 states, where Dalits and tribals along with rights activists and left politicians flayed the apex court and the Modi-led government over the verdict and called for intensifying the movement against it. This comes after the 2 April nationwide shutdown called by the organisation against the verdict. Harping on the “abuse of the Act by vested interests”, an apex court Bench of Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit, in the verdict issued directions in effect diluting the provisions related to immediate arrest for offences under the Act. Besides removing the mandate of immediate arrest under the Act, the   that arrest can be made only after preliminary inquiry and sanction by the competent authority. It also removed the “absolute bar” on an accused taking recourse to anticipatory bail. Faced with growing outrage over the verdict, the Modi government filed a review petition before the SC urging the bench to reconsider its verdict. The apex court is slated to hear the review petition on 3 May. The NCSPA as also the Kerala Government too filed a petition seeking review/ recall of the 20 March judgment.  The NCSPA demonstration in the national capital saw the participation of several political leaders, including Communist Party of India's Rajya Sabha member D Raja, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Brinda Karat and Congress parliamentarian Pradeep Tamta.  Flaying the Modi government over the rising atrocities and crimes against Dalits, Raja dared the Centre to convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the issue and pass an ordinance to negate the verdict. “The SC judgement has virtually made the SC/ST Act redundant. We wanted to raise the issue in Parliament, but the Prime minister and the Government was not willing to debate. So they did not allow Parliament to function. Modi is blaming the Opposition for Parliament not functioning, but it’s them who did not want to it to function,” Raja said. “It’s being said the government is planning to move an ordinance to negate the judgment. If it is so, if the government is really sincere then why don’t they convene a special session of Parliament for this? But they will not do that, because this government is anti-Dalit this government is anti-worker,” said Raja referring to reports of the Centre planning to take the ordinance route. Union minister and the National Democratic Alliance's Dalit face   has said the government will issue an ordinance to uphold the rights SCs and STs if the Supreme Court does not go back on its judgment. Taking on the apex court, Karat said the judgment was a blow to social justice and strengthened the caste system. “The SC used this case to strike a blow to the country’s social justice and the decades of struggles against the caste system. Lakhs of cases are pending before the Supreme Court for years, but in this case, magically the SC came out with verdict within few months of the petition being filed. “It’s not just the SC but the government too played its part in this. The government preferred to remain a mute spectator and only filed the review petition only after faced with intense protests,” said Karat. Spelling out the NCSPA’s charter of demands, National Convener VA Ramesh Nathan said the onus was on the Modi government to set things right. “Rather than confining itself to the petition that was filed over caste discrimination, the SC went beyond and came out with a verdict which has diluted the PoA Act. It’s time for the Centre to act and ensure the law is restored like before. This can be done either through judicial process by revoking the judgment or through parliament by way of an ordinance,” he said.The charter of demands by the NCSPA includes:",2018-05-01 17:51:00+05:30,," Dalits, tribals turn 1 May into Resistance Day against dilution of SC/ST Act | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/
343,Anurag Dey," Ntional President   Friday ridiculed the Opposition’s bid to forge a united front, likening them to dogs and cats. Addressing a rally in Mumbai to mark the party's Foundation Day, Shah also targeted Congress President   for questioning the performance of Narendera Modi government at the Centre. “The countdown for 2019 (Lok Sabha polls) has begun and the Opposition parties are calling for unity among themselves. I have a heard a saying that when everything is washed away in a flood, only a Vat Vriksha (Banyan tree) stands tall. And all the animals, be it the cats, snakes, mongoose, dog, cheetah and the lion, all take refuge on that tree to save themselves from getting washed away. “Afraid of the Modi flood, snakes, bitches, dogs, mongooses, all are trying to contest the polls collectively,” Shah said in Hindi.Targeting Gandhi and his party, Shah said it was four generations of the Congress that need to give explanations to the country.  “Nowadays Rahul Baba (Gandhi) has been spending time with (NCP chief Sharad) Pawar. He must have given some injection that is why now Rahul Baba is daring to ask about four-and-half years of Modi government. “But the it’s the country which is seeking answers from you, four generations of Congress which ruled the country what have you done,” said Shah referring to Gandhi’s meet with Pawar after BJP’s loss in UP bypoll of Phulpur and Gorakhpur seats.  “When we lost the two Lok Sabha seats, Rahul Baba distributed sweets. But what about the  Congress, their candidates even forfeited their deposits. He is perhaps the only leader to distribute sweets when his party candidates forfeit deposits,” said Shah. Besides enumerating various welfare schemes, Shah raked up the Army’s surgical strikes across the LoC, to signify the Modi government’s achievements.  “During Congress rule, Pakistani terrorist would often kill our people and even beheaded our soldiers, but the government could do nothing. So when the Uri terror attack (2016) happened, Modi avenged it withing matter of days by sending soldiers across Pakistan for surgical strikes,” said Shah.  Reaching out to dalits, Shah asserted the BJP government will never abolish reservation system.    “They are now trying spread lies that the BJP diluted the SC/ST Act and claim we want to do away with the reservation system. BJP will never abolish reservation rather if the Congress tries to do that we will prevent them with all our might,” he said.  He also targeted the Congress over the disruption in Parliament that led to washout of a majority of the budget session. “Congress (leader) Ghulam Nabi Azad says that the government is afraid of facing questions in Parliament. We are not afraid, its them who did not allow parliament to function.  “We are ready for debate, why just Parliament, we are ready for debate on any platform. We are not afraid of debate because we have nothing to hide,” said Shah challenging Azad.  Continuing his attack Shah reminded Gandhi about BJP wresting power from it 11 states since 2014.  “We lost two seats, but want to tell Rahul that under Modi we snatched 11 governments from the Congress. From Maharashtra to Haryana from Jharkhand to Manipur, Assam and Uttarakhand, BJP is everywhere.  “Today 20 states and nearly 70% of the country’s population is ruled by BJP. But it is still not our golden period. BJP’s golden period will come when we will have governments in West Bengal and Odisha and retain power in 2019 with absolute majority,” said Shah exhorting partymen to prepare for the next Lok Sabha polls. ""Later at I gave the example of snake and mongoose to highlight the fact that like them these parties are ideologically opposed to each other. But the fear of Modi has brought all of them together,"" Shah said at a press conference.  ""If that has made people take offence then I will use the names, like SP- , TMC-Congress and TDP-Congress. They are all ideologically opposed to each other but are now getting together because of Modi,"" he added.",2018-04-06 16:32:00+05:30,," Amit Shah ridicules Opposition unity, likens them to 'dogs and bitches' | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

345,Ashwin Aghor,", a party that was always critical about dynasty, has just taken one more step towards it. Tejas Thackeray, younger son of party chief   has been projected on party hoardings put up after thumping victory by Yuva Sena in Mumbai University Senate elections. Yuva Sena is youth wing of Shiv Sena headed by Uddhav’s elder son Aditya. He was elevated as Shiv Sena leader in recently held national executive meeting of the party at Mumbai. Speculations are rife that Tejas will be handed over responsibility of Yuva Sena. It was strikingly highlighted in the hoardings put up by Yuva Sean after the victory in Mumbai University Senate elections. For the first time, Tejas featured on any political hoarding of Shiv Sena or Yuva Sena. It is a clear indication that Uddhav is promoting his younger son to take the charge of Yuva Sena. Unlike his father and elder brother, Tejas had been low profile. He came into limelight for the first time when Tejas discovered five species of fresh water crabs in February last year and one of them was named after him.  Being in oblivion since then, Tejas suddenly hit the limelight when his photo appeared on party hoarding recently. Shiv Sena Secretary Milind Narvekar put Tejas’ photo on the advertisement published in party mouthpiece Saamna, congratulating Yuva Sean for the victory in Mumbai University Senate elections.  “It is the beginning of branding Tejas as politician who in all probabilities will soon be heading Yuva Sena. The post will be vacated once Aditya completely shifts to Shiv Sena,” said a senior Shiv Sena leader who did not wish to be named.  Shiv Sena Spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “Tejas is a keen environmentalist and social activist. Party cadre will definitely welcome the decision if the leadership decides to induct him in the Yuva Sena.” The youth wing of Shiv Sena, won all the 10 seats to Mumbai University Senate under the leadership of Aditya Thackeray recently. This thumping victory and Aditya’s elevation to Shiv Sena was the right time to induct Tejas in the politics, feels another senior party leader.  “Once Aditya was elevated to Shiv Sena as leader, it was obvious that he would gradually withdraw from the day to day affairs of Yuva Sena. And in that situation, Tejas can step in elder brother’s shoes and take over the youth wing,” the leader said. Once Tejas takes over Yuva Sena, Aditya will concentrate on forthcoming state Assembly and Lok Sabha elections with his father. “The victory in the Mumbai University Senate elections is the concrete evidence that people have complete faith in Shiv Sena and its ideology. This victory is result of the social service we have been doing over the last eight years. “Similar activities are being carried out by Shiv Sena. It will help us in forthcoming state Assembly and Lok Sabha elections as well,” said Aditya Thackeray. After elevation to Shiv Sena as one of the eight first line leaders, Aditya will now focus on the affairs of Shiv Sena. “In fact, his progression to Shiv Sena bagan in 2014 when he was part of the team that discussed seat sharing with BJP,” said a Shiv Sena leader. While Shiv Sena leaders are enthusiastic about the development, the other parties such as   (BJP) and Congress apparently have decided not to comment on it, saying it was the internal matter of Shiv Sena.",2018-04-06 17:51:00+05:30,, Is Shiv Sena staring at Dynasty 2.0? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

347,Neeraj Thakur,"Hinduism has been debated over and defined innumerable times by an array of theologians, sages, kings and philosophers. Going by the records of interpretations of Hinduism, it would be difficult to point out one particular way or ritual that could be defined as peculiarly Hindu. From the Vedas, to the Upanishads and the Puranas, one finds a number of different, often contradictory versions on the Hindu philosophy and rituals attached to it. In this context, the title of Shashi Tharoor’s new volume ‘Why I am a Hindu', makes it clear that the politician-author is staying away from prescribing his Hinduism to others. He is putting out his understanding of the religion that he was born in and in the process raises questions for his readers to ponder before blindly subscribing to any interpretation of this millennia-old religion.  The idea of political Hinduism was first introduced by Mahatma Gandhi during India’s freedom movement against the British. It is believed that without Gandhi’s call for a Ram Rajya – essentially a Hindu theocratic state – it would not have been possible for   to become a party of the masses. However, soon after Gandhi fired the imaginations of the masses with his idea of a Ram Rajya, a section of Hindu hardliners (including Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh or RSS) emerged. Over the years, it redefined the meaning of Ram Rajya – focusing on aggressive analogies from the religious traditions of Hinduism in an attempt to give a monotheistic face to a religion that had evolved in a polytheistic manner.  This changed Hinduism is fast becoming popular and has given a clear majority to a non-Congress party only the second time since Independence. Given the role that religion has played in Indian politics, since the days of freedom struggle, Tharoor’s theological polemic is an attempt at reclaiming the fast fading idea of Hinduism that helped Gandhi to move the masses- from the RSS version of it under the nomenclature of Hindutva (a term coined by BJP’s icon, VD Savarkar). Tharoor is a prolific writer with close to two dozen titles to his name that deal with varied subjects ranging from politics, history, sociology, culture and religion. This kind of scholarship, takes Tharoor closer to the legacy of none other than Jawaharlal Nehru, who in his book, ‘Discovery Of India’ also made an attempt to explain Hindu traditions and its ever evolving nature to accommodate newer streams of philosophy that emerged with the passage of time. Nehru talked about the reasons behind the fall of Indian Civilization that surrendered to the British. Tharoor, in his thesis on Hinduism, is drawing attention to the immediate danger that looms over this age-old civilisation due to the emergence of an exclusivist interpretation of an inclusive way of life. Tharoor, quotes with ease chronologically from Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, epics to put forth an idea that while each of the sacred texts that are part of Hinduism are important none of them can claim to be superior to the other: “ Hinduism has not one sacred book, but several, both complementary and contradictory to each other. The Hindu scriptures are commonly divided into Srutis, Smritis, Itihasas, Puranas, Agamas and Darshanas.” Since Tharoor is countering RSS/BJP-supported Hindutva, which has entered the kitchens of people enforcing upon them the eating habits of North Indian Brahmins, he quotes the tradition of ‘animal sacrifices’, in the Rig Veda, “including those of cattle.” Giving vivid description of the six Indian philosophical schools of thought, Tharoor, argues that Hinduism has the tradition of even accepting atheism – unlike Abrahmic religions – therefore any attempt to limit it to a particular ritual or any one religious book would be against the essence of the tradition of the Indian civilisation that has travelled a long way from the days of Indus Valley Civilisation. While the BJP, as a part of its project to consolidate the Hindu philosophy has tried to selectively appropriate certain Hindu philosophers, Tharoor, cleverly, for his readers brings alive many more souls who have contributed to the tradition of this religion. Tharoor does not stop there, he pitches the philosophy of Vivekananda against that of Golwalkar. Quoting Swami Vivekananda’s speech to the Chicago convention in which he defended the idea of freedom to choose one’s way of worshiping God, Tharoor builds a narrative against the later Hindutva ideologues who the BJP takes inspiration from. “Unity in variety is the plan of nature, and the Hindu has recognized it. Every other religion lays down certain fixed dogmas and tries to compel the society to adopt them. It places before society only one coat which must fit Jack and John and Henry, all alike. If it does not fit John or Henry, he must go without Coat to cover his body. The Hindus have discovered that the absolute can only be realized or thought of or stated through the relative and the images, crosses and crescents are simply so many symbols – so many pegs to hang spiritual ideas on. It is not that this help is necessary for everyone, but those that do not need it have no right to say that it is wrong. Nor is it compulsory in Hinduism.” Compare the above mentioned idea of Vivekananda with the following one put forth by M.S Golwalkar- the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS in his treatise ‘ We, or our Nationahood defined’: “To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic Races – the Jews. Race pride at its highest has been manifested here. Germany has also shown how well nigh impossible it is for Races and cultures, having differences going to the root, to be assimilated into one united Whole, a good lesson for us In Hindustan to learn and profit by.” Tharoor, by drawing comparison between two different streams of thoughts on the idea of India, nature and its culture, leaves it to his readers to take a call on what type of Hinduism would they want to espouse – Vivekanada’s or Golwalkar’s ? Tharoor has not kept his book limited to dealing with only the ancient values of Hinduism. The second part of his book defines the limits and possibilities of a modern India. He talks about hunger, poverty, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and secularism. It is an attempt by Tharoor to prescribe the assimilation of newer democratic values in this age old religion. By doing so, he widens the scope of his book from being concerned with only theological pursuits, to something that concerns sociology and constitutional debates as well. The battle between Hindusim and Hindutva is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon, more so because the propounders of the latter after a struggle of close to 100 years have built their stronghold among a sizeable chunk of the country’s population. But such books are not written for immediate results. It is aimed at taking on the idea of exclusivist identity of Hinduism- something that takes selectively from the past to serve the political purposes of the present.  Why I am a Hindu is an important addition in the tradition of intra-religion theological debate. How these ideas percolate down among followers of Hinduism will decide the future course of India's politics.",2018-04-07 19:04:00+05:30,, Why I am a Hindu book review: Shashi Tharoor takes on political Hindutva with his personal Hinduism | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

357,Sebastian Sunny,"  JAIPUR: The exit of poet and Aaam Admi Party( ) leader Kumar Vishvas as the in charge of party affairs in Rajasthan  a day back was as dramatic as his nomination to the post some eight months ago. As the appointment was without much logic as Kumar had no special connection with or knowledge of Rajasthan, his removal too was devoid of any special reason though the AAP insiders attribute it to “inaction”. The party leader Ashutosh, who announced the replacement of Kumar Vishvas as Rajasthan “prabhari” a day before  had termed the latter’s lack of time as the reason for excusing the fiery poet, now on a confrontation course with the AAP leadership, including its coordinator and Delhi Chief Minister  . Kumar’s disappointment over the denial of a Rajya Sabha ticket to him by the party is known to all. Now, he has been replaced by Deepak Bajpai, the national treasurer of the party, who is also a member of the party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC).  Deepak Bajpai, who also happens to be a former media person—as many AAP leaders are-- has been active in Rajasthan in the past two months, touring districts and making attempts at enlisting local leaders in the party. AAP, which has set up a camp in the outskirts of Jaipur on Tonk Road,   is trying hard to make a foothold in the desert state by making tie-ups with likeminded groups and political parties like the CPI and the CPI (M). As such the party lacks an organizational structure in the State. “Kumar Vishvas had to go because he could not spare any time in Rajasthan where elections are due by the end of the year,” said Devendra Shastri, AAP spokesperson for Rajasthan, talking to Catch News.  Kumar was given enough time but he failed to make any link with the people and media in the State. “In the past eight months he visited Rajasthan only four times. Fan following in kavi sammelans is one thing and connecting with people politically is something else,” he noted. The party pointed out that Kumar Vishvas was not doing anything in Rajasthan for the coming elections and at the same time he was not stepping down himself. That necessitated the present action as time was running out. In the PAC meeting of AAP in Delhi two days back Rajasthan elections figured prominently and the party, it appears, is determined to invest its time and resources in the State. Despite the absence of any breakthrough for it in public and in the matter of getting hitherto established leaders of other parties to its fold, the AAP leadership thinks that Rajasthan holds promises for it. This is also because of the impression that the popularity of the ruling BJP is on the decline and the state does not have a third force. AAP thinks that it can fill the vacuum. Though it may appear grossly unrealistic, it is learnt that the party is preparing to contest from all 200 seats in the State along with its allies.  The party is in touch with the Left parties for a possible alliance in the coming Assembly elections while at the same time it is also on an attempt to woo party rebels from both the BJP and the Congress, besides former and present Independent MLAs.  Along with a tie-up with the Left and other likeminded parties, AAP is looking for a common ground for the campaign. ",2018-04-12 21:35:00+05:30,, AAP gearing up for Rajasthan polls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

361,Akash Bisht,"Sporting a red tilak, Congress President  , while campaigning in Amethi, lambasted Prime Minister   for destroying the country's banking system after reports emerged that several cash dispensers in the country have run dry. However, Gandhi, who in the recent past has lost no opportunity to attack the government, remained uncannily silent on the acquittal of Aseemanand and four others in the 2007 Mecca Masjid Blast that killed nine and injured dozens. Not even his party has said much on the judgement which witnessed a dramatic twist after the judge that acquitted the accused resigned soon after giving the verdict. When asked about the party's reaction on the verdict, party's national general secretary and in-charge of organisations and training, Ashok Gehlot called it a judicial matter and said he would not like to comment on it. “It is now up to the government to examine the order and decide if a further appeal is required. As it is a judicial matter, I would not like to comment on it,” he said Monday. Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, too tried to avoid the question. When repeatedly asked, he only had this to say: “There is always the option of appealing in higher courts.” The most interesting response came from senior party leader PL Punia, who was asked to comment on BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra's allegations that the Congress had coined the term 'saffron terror'. In his response, Punia said, “Rahul Gandhi or the Congress party have never used the term 'saffron terror'. It's baseless. There is no term like 'saffron terror'. We believe that terror cannot be linked to any religion, community or caste. Criminal mentality leads to criminal activities which should not be linked to any community or religion.” While other Opposition parties have attacked the BJP government for diluting the case, Congress has so far maintained an eerie silence. Congress leaders might deny coining the term 'saffron terror', but there is ample evidence to suggest otherwise. It was probably first used by the then Home Minister P Chidambaram in 2010 when he cautioned the chiefs of state police forces, security and intelligence officials against saffron terrorism. “There is no let up in the attempts to radicalise young men and women in India. Besides, there is the recently uncovered phenomenon of saffron terrorism that has been implicated in many bomb blasts of the past. My advice to you is that we must remain ever vigilant and continue to build, at the Central and State levels, our capacity in counter-terrorism,” he was quoted by the The Hindu in 2010. Thereafter, in 2013, party leader   Shinde had accused BJP and RSS of promoting “Hindu terrorism”. Back then several senior party leaders had backed Shinde who was eventually forced to issue a clarification. According to a cable by former US ambassador, which was released by Wikileaks in 2010, even Rahul had mentioned how radicalised Hindu groups were a bigger threat to India. So, why did Congress or Rahul not raise this issue when all the accused were acquitted by the court despite several reports of how the entire probe was scuttled? The resignation of the judge and appointment of a public prosecutor who has no experience in criminal trial – and was a member of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad – being handed such a sensitive case does raise serious questions about the way the probe was conducted. And, yet the Congress remained silent. The only logical reason for this ignorance could be the upcoming polls in various states, particularly Karnataka. With elections in the southern state only a fortnight away, the Congress would not have wanted to be seen as an anti-Hindu entity considering how Rahul has been temple hopping in the state to get support of the majority community. In the past, Congress has often been accused by the BJP of minority appeasement while ignoring the sentiments of the majority community. Rahul had adopted a similar strategy in Gujarat where it, for the first time in the last many years, was able to give BJP a tough fight in their own bastion. Though Congress failed to form government, it succeeded in confining BJP's tally to not cross two digits. Elated with such a response, the party has deployed a similar strategy in Karnataka and is likely to adopt it other states where it goes to polls later this year. Perhaps for this reason that the party has held itself back from raising Aseemanand's acquittal to ensure it isn't seen as a party that represents the interests of only one community. In fact, after its disastrous performance in 2014, the party had formed AK Anthony committee to look into the reasons for its failures. In his report, Anthony had claimed that the party was increasingly seen as pro-minorities which had done little to protect the interests of the majority community. His observations found many takers in the party and eventually in 2017 during the Gujarat elections, the Grand Old Party decided to woo the Hindus with Rahul visiting temples across the state. “It would have been foolish to get drawn into this anti-Hindu debate being created by the BJP. We have an election to fight in Karnataka and taking the BJP's bait could cost us the elections. We have to be very careful. Moreover, everyone knows what Congress is all about,” said a senior party leader from Karnataka. This leader, however, agreed that its not secret that investigating agencies are being pressurised by the government to let the accused go scot-free. And yet, he would not want to go one record on this. “There is no official or unofficial diktat to not speak on these issues but Congress leaders know that they have to avoid it at all costs. We do not want to have a Mani Shanker Aiyer-like moment right before the polls,” he said.",2018-04-17 19:26:00+05:30,, Mum seems to be the word for Congress on Mecca Masjid.

366,Rajeev Khanna,"For the first time in almost three-and-a-half decades Punjab's students would get to elect representatives to students' councils. Tuesday the Amarinder Singh government announced elections to student unions in universities will be held from the 2018-19 academic session, thus fulfilling one of the promises made by Congress before last year's Assembly elections. Apart from establishing a democratic process at grassroots, this will also be a major indicator of what the youth thinks and wants. In addition, a new political leadership can also emerge from educational institutions now instead of only from rich and powerful families. Though there are still several issues related to the implementation of the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations in the universities, it is a positive start. Captain Singh pointed out such elections were suspended due to the state's disturbed law-and-order situation in the past. Now that there is peace and normalcy, students' elections will take place regularly. The Panjab University, Chandigarh had seen a return of elections in 1996, following a sustained agitation by the student and youth leaders. Amarinder said students' union elections would be held in Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar; Punjabi University, Patiala and Punjab Technical University, Jalandhar along with their affiliated colleges. Other universities where elections are to be held include Baba Farid University of Health and Medical Sciences, Kotkapura; Punjab Agriculture University and Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University both in Ludhiana. Elections to the students' bodies were discontinued at the height of militancy in Punjab after Operation Blue Star in 1984. The perception then was that universities were hotbeds of militancy and several militants took refuge in campuses. Also, criminal elements had started using student politics as covert. Normalcy returned to Punjab by mid-'90s, but no party in power displayed the political will to resume students' elections despite demanding and making political commitments.  There are various views on this. One: students with political aspirations have often accused rich, powerful families of resisting students' polls as they could hamper the political prospects of their own progenies.  The other view is that political parties had no inkling of the thought process of the youth and lack of political debate was being seen as one of the reasons for the youth going directionless. Political observers think such elections would provide an opportunity to various political forces to groom their armies right from the grassroots. In addition, leaders would also emerge on merit of their understanding of political thought from campuses instead of from a few families with clout. Punjab has two major student organisations – the National Students Union of India (NSUI), affiliated witto the Congress, and the Students Organisation of India (SOI), the students wing of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).  In addition, there are Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) – student wing of rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh – the Students Federation of India (SFI), backed by Communist Party of India (Marxist).  Several other leftist student's organisations also work at the grassroots and bring out of various publications and organise people's movements in rural areas. In the '80s the All India Sikh Students Federation (AISSF) had a strong presence. The government's decision is expected to improve considerably political debate, the standards of which are particularly worse in private universities where students are treated almost as in primary schools with political debates and activities being prohibited. Recently the Manohar Lal Khattar government in Haryana also re-introduced such polls after almost 22 years. Elections had been done away with by the earlier Bansi Lal-led Haryana Vikas Party (HVP) government in the state on the grounds of growing violence in campuses, including murders.  The decision came after a sustained agitation by Indian National Students Organization (INSO), the student wing of the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD). Even the NSUI and SFI had been demanding these elections. The re-introduction of students' polls are expected to give a new shape to politics in both these states. It remains to be seen how the change comes about and who capitalises on students' politics.",2018-03-28 13:30:00+05:30,, Student council polls to be back in Punjab.

368,Rajeev Khanna,"The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has arrived on the political scene in Haryana. The party has decided to contest all 90 seats in the next Assembly elections there, scheduled to be held a little after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. This was announced by Delhi chief minister and AAP National Convener   at a huge public rally in Hisar Sunday. It was Kejriwal's first major public outing in the region after the Punjab polls. There the party, after threatening to walk away with the winners' trophy, had to contend with being the main Opposition. In Haryana, AAP does enjoy some advantages. At the same it also has several questions to answer.  Haryana is the home turf of Kejriwal and some of the ministers and legislators the party has in Delhi. It can make a marked presence particularly in the areas of the National Capital Region (NCR) using a spill over of its Delhi support base. AAP volunteers have been quietly working on the ground for sometime, which was evident from the response of people in the rally. Party's Haryana chief Naveen Jaihind said it would offer the Delhi model of governance to the people of Haryana: “basic amenities like power and water at cheaper rates, more compensation to families of martyrs, more remuneration and compensation to farmers.” In fact, the implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission is one of the major promises made by Kejriwal in his speech at the rally held at Old College Ground in Hisar. He said AAP will strive continuously to overthrow the ruling   (BJP). He accused the BJP of organising riots in the country and said both the Congress and the BJP were responsible for riots between Jats and non Jats. Caste violence continued unabated in the last three years and Manohar Lal Khattar government slept over it, he added. Holding the central government responsible for a series of bank frauds Kejriwal posed a question to Modi asking when will defaulters like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya be brought back to India. He said the people are worried where to deposit their hard earned money as none of the banks is safe.  Armed with documents Kejriwal told the audience that the Centre has filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court saying that it would not implement the Swaminathan Commission report. He took an oath saying that AAP would implement it on coming to power in the state and Haryana would be the first beneficiary. Kejriwal also attacked the state government on poor health facilities, education facilities and the degrading law-and-order scenario. He said the corrupt practices introduced by the previous government of Bhupinder Singh Hooda have seen a five-time rise in the Khattar regime. He said AAP would soon start a door-to-door campaign in the state. Delhi's Labour and Employment Minister Gopal Rai, who is also AAP's Haryana in-charge, said the state has made valuable contribution in Delhi's development and Delhi Transport Corporation as well as Delhi Police owe their success to Haryana.  But questions remain. AAP needs to convince the masses that it is a serious contender and would not back out from contesting it did in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, leaving enthusiastic supporters disappointed.  The party will have to ensure it does not make the mistakes it made in Punjab where over-ambitious leaders justified the saying of too many cooks spoiling the broth. The party will have to make its presence felt in the heartland of the state to debunk the theory being propagated by several observers that it will just prove to be a force that will cut into the vote share of the existing non BJP parties, the Indian National Lok Dal and the Congress. With AAP announcing its entry into the poll fray just a little more than a year ahead of the Lok Sabha and Haryana assembly polls it remains to be seen how the political matrix of the state changes in the coming months.",2018-03-26 17:10:00+05:30,, AAP wants to contest in Haryana ; Can it change the political matrix of the state | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
369,Akash Bisht,"With General elections a little over a year away a gamut of parties have started assessing their positions, especially vis-a-vis the   (BJP). In this respect, the political situation in Uttar Pradesh has become particularly interesting, what with the state sending the most number of members to Parliament. The coming together of   (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party ( ) in recent bye-polls have opened up new possibilities and stakeholders are closely assessing the situation. A transfer of votes between the two parties can potentially be a  .  Needless to say, when battle lines are drawn, BJP's bete noire Congress would want to be in the game. But how accommodating would others be to the Grand Old Party, especially since creases to a prospective alliance remain unironed.  Already, BSP supremo   sprang a surprise Tuesday, a day after claiming the alliance with the SP would not be hampered by the defeat of BSP's Bhim Rao Ambedkar in the recent Rajya Sabha elections. Now the BSP will no more activate its cadres in any upcoming bye-election the way it did in Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-polls, the Dalit leader said Tuesday. This has come as a major setback for the SP, which will now have to contest bye-polls for Kairana Lok Sabha and Noorpur assembly seats on its own. Mayawati had asked her cadres to support SP candidates in the two earlier bye-polls, which helped  's party clinch massive victories in the seats earlier represented by Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya. In return, it was decided that the SP would vote Ambedkar for Rajya Sabha. Ambedkar's loss led to political pundits writing obituaries of a potentially formidable social coalition. Amid speculations, Mayawati reiterated support for the alliance Sunday and Monday, saying it would be good for the country. According to her, any effort by ruling BJP to create a divide between the two parties would only backfire. She urged other parties to join hands too.  Her flip-flop can leave the SP unnerved. Meanwhile, BSP sources downplayed her comments, claiming the alliance was here to stay. By not activating her cadres, particularly in Kairana, she wanted to send a strong signal to   (RLD), which was planning to field party chief Ajit Singh's son Jayant Chaudhary.  The party had pledged support for Ambedkar for the upper house of Parliament, but the vote by its legislator was declared void. Mayawati thinks this was on purpose, to help the BJP, and said she would rethink about any understanding with RLD. A BSP source said the invalid vote could have triggered Mayawati's strong reaction: “She doesn't contest bye-polls, but this does send a strong signal to possible allies.”  UP Capital Lucknow has been abuzz ever since Mayawati publicly supported an alliance with SP. Senior politicians have been meeting respective party leaderships to secure election tickets. Speculations are rife that the BSP has already started preparations for 2019 General Elections, identifying seats it would like to contest.   recently claimed the BSP chief might fight from Ambedkarnagar – a clear departure from her earlier stand of not contesting election. While the two parties seem to be close to sealing a deal, others – particularly Congress – will have to bargain hard. Numbers are not stacked in favour of the Grand Old Party for it to have a say in seat-sharing and it will have to give up its ego if it wants to enter the alliance.  Senior Congress leadership may hope to be treated on a par with the two allies, but both the SP and the BSP dismisses that. Congress's decision to contested Phulpur and Gorakhpur irked their leaderships who are not averse to fighting without the Congress in case it demands “more than what they deserve”. A senior Congress leader recently dismissed the idea of the party being a junior partner in an alliance and said the demand would be for an equal share of seats to contest. “Should we down shutters? We are the oldest party and deserve some respect,” he said. When asked whether contesting the bye-polls was a mistake, he denied and said the party should have been given one seat to contest by the alliance.  The party did push for a seat – a demand that was categorically turned down by the SP. “They remain oblivious to the harsh realities on the ground. Had we given them a seat, we would have lost. Strategically, an alliance with Congress is not even in our favour and we can very well do without it,” a senior SP leader said. When asked how many seats would the Congress be allotted if it enters into alliance, he promptly said: “Two – we want their top leadership to win but that is it. They do not have winnable candidates and even if we rally behind them, it could still be a lost cause.”  In fact, even the Congress is divided over the number of seats it deserves to contest. A Congress leader from the state claimed there were not more than five out of UP's 80 Lok Sabha seats the party could win next year.  For the SP leader, even five was a tall number. “We gave them enough in the past. Look at the results – out of the 105 seats it contested in 2017, it won only seven – a proof of its popularity in the state,” he said.  Negotiating with Congress was hard work, according to him. “One leader would want some seats, another some others – there's too much confusion. Also, they scheme against each other. Congress is like Kalidas who cut the branch on which it sits,” he said. According to him, Congress should focus on other states where it is powerful if it wanted to see   defeated. “We have to work together at different levels if we have to fight the common enemy. Inflated egos won't win elections, but ensure defeat,” he said.  Mayawati too wasn't pleased with Congress, sources said. Especially, the induction of Nasimuddin Siddiqui, a former BSP man, into Congress hasn't gone down well with her. She was also upset with the party fighting bye-polls. A BSP source said others like RLD, NISHAD, Peace Party, Apna Dal might have to be accommodated in a broader alliance, something that would make it increasingly difficult for Congress to jostle for more seats.  In 2014, the BSP came second on 34 seats. Mayawati would like to fight those as well as a few more. The SP too would prefer a similar number. That leaves less than 10 seats for other allies. “Realistically, Congress should not be given more than five seats but it depends on future negotiations,” a BSP source said. Meanwhile, top Congress leaders have already started approaching the state leadership for seats. “It also depends on how many of them can win,” said Ramesh Dixit, state president of Nationalist Congress Party. It was too premature to discuss seat sharing, considering Congress was not yet in the alliance, he said. “Other parties also are yet to join the alliance. Every effort should be made to build a grand alliance to defeat the BJP, but every party should be reasonable with its demand,” Dixit said. He claimed the Karnataka Assembly elections on 12 May could be a turning point as could be the polls in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. However, he said, it would still be tough for the Congress.  “Look at their recent performances in the state. No party or alliance that has the potential to defeat the BJP would want to lose seats to satiate the ego of an alliance partner. That's not how politics works. “Congress will have to be realistic, else it will end up damaging the chances of those who have better chances of defeating the BJP,” he said.  Nationally, several parties have already started discussions. West Bengal Chief Minister Tuesday met NCP chief Sharad Pawar and  's Sanjay Raut while her Telangana counterpart K Chandrasekhara Rao recently called on her. Such trends could eventually lead to regional satraps coming together to form a non-BJP, non-Congress front. Congress thus needs to think seriously. It would have to cut dow on ego if it seriously wants to give the BJP a tough fight.",2018-03-27 21:16:00+05:30,, Uttar Pradesh may decide fate of Lok Sabha 2019.

Even a section within the ruling   and its allies expressed opposition. “We have filed a comprehensive review petition that will be presented before the court,” Union Law Minister   said Monday. On 20 March an apex court Bench of Justices AK Goel and UU Lalit, while examining the need for procedural safeguards to prevent the abuse of the SC/ST Act, issued directions in effect diluting the provisions related to immediate arrest for offences under the Act. Observing that “there are instances of abuse of the Act by vested interests” the Bench removed the mandate of immediate arrest under the Act and directed that arrest can be made only after preliminary inquiry and sanction by the competent authority. It also removed the “absolute bar” on an accused taking recourse to anticipatory bail.  In the verdict, the Bench laid the following:  The Bench also stated that any violation of the directives (2) and (3) “will be actionable by way of disciplinary action as well as contempt.” The court stated that “to avoid false implication, before FIR is registered, preliminary enquiry may be made whether the case falls in the parameters of the Atrocities Act and is not frivolous or motivated”. With the court’s directive, not only a person accused under the Act will not be arrested unless a preliminary enquiry is conducted to ascertain the veracity of the charges, but s/he also has the relief of seeking anticipatory bail, which was hitherto unavailable.  Deliberating on section 18 of the SC/ST Act that bars the applicability of anticipatory bail to an accused, the Bench observed that the legislature “never intended to use the Atrocities Act as an instrument to blackmail or to wreak personal vengeance”. “It has been judicially acknowledged that there are instances of abuse of the Act by vested interests against political opponents in Panchayat, Municipal or other elections, to settle private civil disputes arising out of property, monetary disputes, employment disputes and seniority disputes. It may be noticed that by way of rampant misuse complaints are ‘largely being filed particularly against Public Servants/quasi judicial/judicial officers with oblique motive for satisfaction of vested interests’. “Innocent citizens are termed as accused, which is not intended by the legislature. The legislature never intended to use the Atrocities Act as an instrument to blackmail or to wreak personal vengeance.  “The Act is also not intended to deter public servants from performing their bona fide duties. Thus, unless exclusion of anticipatory bail is limited to genuine cases and inapplicable to cases where there is no prima facie case was made out, there will be no protection available to innocent citizens. Thus, limiting the exclusion of anticipatory bail in such cases is essential for protection of fundamental right of life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution,” the Bench said. During the hearing, the petitioner while arguing on misuse and abuse of the Act, pointed to the low conviction rate of cases and “large number” of false cases. It was pointed out that in 2015, out of 15638 cases decided by the courts, 11,024 cases resulted in acquittal or discharge, 495 cases were withdrawn and 4,119 cases resulted in conviction. Quoting the National Crime Records Bureau figures, the petitioner stated that in 2016, over 6,000 cases were found to be “false”. The court was also informed that out of the cases disposed of by courts in 2015, more than 75% resulted in acquittal/withdrawal or compounding of the cases.  The court, in this regard, observed:  “We are satisfied, in the light of statistics already referred as well as cited decisions and observations of the Standing Committee of Parliament that there is need to safeguard innocent citizens against false implication and unnecessary arrest for which there is no sanction under the law which is against the constitutional guarantee and law of arrest laid down by this Court. “... the said Act cannot be converted into a charter for exploitation or oppression by any unscrupulous person or by police for extraneous reasons against other citizens as has been found on several occasions in decisions referred to above.  “This Court must enforce such a guarantee. Law should not result in caste hatred. The preamble to the Constitution, which is the guiding star for interpretation, incorporates the values of liberty, equality and fraternity. While the Bench reiterated the misuse and abuse of the provisions of the Act, what it failed to realise as pointed out by experts, that the low conviction rate was actually a reflection of the way cases under the Act are registered and pursued.  Human Rights Watch in a report “Hidden Apartheid: Caste Discrimination against India’s ‘Untouchables” had observed: “The low rate of convictions, compared against the high number of atrocities reported against Dalits, speaks to the caste bias of prosecutors, as well as other organs of justice, including the judiciary. On the very day of the judgment, Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment   in Lok Sabha informed that the number of cases of offences of atrocities against members of SCs registered under the Act in conjunction with the IPC, have gone up to 40,774 in 2016 from the 38,564 in 2015.  According to  , the number of cases of crime against SCs pending for trial has increased manifolds. From 85,264 case in 2006 the figure has seen a 50% rise to reach 1,29,831 case by 2016. Besides the removal of bar on anticipatory bail, experts say the court’s mandate for a preliminary inquiry by a senior police officer and sanction by the competent authority for a accused to be arrested, has dealt a death blow to Act that was enacted with the objective of eradicating inherent discriminatory attitudes against SCs and STs. Experts have also strongly objected to the court making punishable any violation of its directives of a preliminary enquiry and prior sanction for pursuing against an accused under the Act.  With many of the cases of atrocities under the Act either going unreported or the investigators reluctant to pursue with the case, the court’s diktats will only lead to further rise in the malaise. The court verdict has come at a time when the country under the Modi regime has been witnessing a spate of caste related violence.  The rise in incidents of violence against Dalits led to the government in January 2016 introduce amendments in the SC/ST Act whereby new offences of atrocities like tonsuring of head, moustache, garlanding with chappals, dispose or carry human or animal carcasses, etc were introduced.  Besides adding a chapter on the ‘Rights of Victims and Witnesses’, the amendment Act also provides for establishing “Exclusive Special Courts’ to ensure speedy and expeditious disposal of cases.  While reflecting on the abuse of the Act, many say the Bench ought to have reflected on the series of incidents where Dalits have been subjected to violence and discrimination. The latest: a man from Hathras (Uttar Pradesh), who has been writing to various authorities for months to seek help for taking out his marriage procession through a village dominated by upper castes. Just days ahead of the Apex court verdict, the man,  , moved the Allahabad High Court with his plea.  The verdict has created ripples within the centre’s ruling National Democratic Alliance. A section of Parliamentarians with SC/ST background from the BJP and ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) of Ram Vilas Paswan held talks with Prime Minister Modi, Union Social Justice Minister Thawar Chand Gehlot and wrote to Prasad. Questioning her party’s inaction over the issue, BJP MP Savitri Bai Phule has asserted her resistance against any bid to tamper with reservation system.",2018-04-02 15:57:00+05:30,, Bharat bandh: How Supreme Court decision will affect Dalits | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
378,Sulagna Sengupta,"Will this year's Ram Navami turn out to be a watershed in the way politics is done in West Bengal? Or is this rampant violence a passing phase? These are questions foremost in the mind of socio-cultural analysts and political observers. Ram Navami processions took a bloody turn Sunday with clashes between supporters of Trinamool Congress and   (BJP) – the political parties in power in the state and the Centre respectively – at several places throughout the state. Since then the violence has continued and has taken a communal turn. Even Thursday television cameras captured a tense Asansol. A predominantly Hindi-speaking Hindu mass complaining their processions were pelted with stones while Muslims alleged that   against them were raised in such processions. Union Minister of State for Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises Babul Supriyo, who represents Asansol in Lok Sabha, now has an FIR registered against him for violating Section 144 even as the police stopped him from entering the city. He, in turn, demanded that the Mamata Banerjee government be sacked.This followed fresh violence in the Asansol-Raniganj coal belt Wednesday after which the state administration issued prohibitory orders, sent a huge contingent of police led by three senior officers, clamped down on internet services and asked local TV channels to not broadcast anythingn that could trigger violence. The situation reached this stage as villagers in the area resisted a BJP rally Monday. In the ensuing clash 10 villagers were injured and an Indian Police Service officer lost an arm while trying to defuse a crude bomb. In another instance, a statue of freedom fighter Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad was overthrown by a mob sporting saffron bandannas in North 24 Parganas district's Kakinara. Before that, Sunday a man died after being caught in a clash between the police and rival Ram Navami processions. There were many more instances of violence between the two parties and   at several rallies. Even as the state continued to cope with violence Chief Mamata Banerjee was seen New Delhi, meeting senior politicians from various Opposition parties Tuesday and Wednesday.  Politicians, expectedly, blamed each other. BJP State President Dilip Ghosh blamed Trinamool's “double standards” and said “While (the party's) goons tried to create disturbance in various areas, the police and administration failed to discharge their duties.” Jishnu Bose, state general secretary of BJP's mentor   (RSS), alleged the Azad statue was vandalised by Trinamool goons carrying BJP flags. He also claimed that several workers of Trinamool and Communist Party of India (Marxist) joined RSS rallies. Trinamool's Sourav Chakraborty, member of the Legislative Assembly from Alipurduar, was spotted at an RSS Ram Navami rally Sunday. In Kakinara too, sources said, Trinamool legislator Arjun Singh was in a procession with RSS workers. He though denied that and blamed RSS for vandalising the Azad statue. The CPM's Surjya Kanta Mishra, meanwhile, blamed parties of “wanton competitive communalism” and wondered why could the state not seek central forces if its own contingents fell short. Chief Minister Banerjee has already turned down a Central offer for the same and held back Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi from visiting the disturbed coal belt area. As the political class traded blames, the situation has left the state's intellectuals worried. They see a trend that was set ever since winning two Lok Sabha seats in 2014 made the BJP try to garner more by consolidating Hindu votes. That Trinamool is now competing with it will only increase religious polarisation, they feel. One question that has been on everybody's mind is why did Trinamool take out Ram Navami rallies in the first place? A Kolkata-based intellectual leaning towards Trinamool claimed the party had to do so to keep the BJP from creating communal disturbances in the state. It couldn't take a risk after the saffron party made its intention clear with  . Veteran historian Nrisingha Prasad Bhaduri, however, felt that was pointless: “If a ruling party needs to showcase strength, it should be in the vote bank rather than giving too much attention to Ram Navami rallies. A counter rally signifies it is giving importance to another party.” In a state where caste and religion did not dominate politics, such “competitive communalism was detrimental”, politica analyst Amol Mukherjee said. “This will widen religious polarisation and increase communal tension. Evern since coming to power in 2014 the BJP has tried to consolidate Hindu votes and communal clashes have increased eg, Dhulagarh and Baisrhat,” said the former principal of Presidency College. He agreed with Bhaduri that Trinamool had better not organised rallies: “The ruling party must understand it has not been elected to indulge in competitive communalism. It should rather act when law is violated. It is necessary not to give mileage to such rallies.” Theatre activist Koushik Sen pointed out that the state had a strong social fabric. The need was to introspect what's good for the society. “Such rallies showcasing arms are not only detrimental to the society but also a cause of concern for the common people,” he said highlighting the death of one villager Sunday.  “Trinamool's counter-rallies only prove it would copy the BJP. That would only give an edge to the BJP help increase its base in Bengal,” Imankalyan Lahiri, professor of International Relations at Jadavpur University, said. “It's the duty of all political parties to maintain law and order. They should not indulge in wanton competitive communalism,” Sohini Roy, who has taught Sociology in St Xaviers College, said. “It is dangerous for Bengal, which has never been ruled by caste or religious politics. As a symbol of its unity, Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore once celebrated Raksha Bandhan between Hindus and Muslims,” she added.",2018-03-30 00:03:00+05:30,, Did this Ram Navami change politics in Bengal  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

381,Charu Kartikeya,"By withdrawing its controversial notification about fake news, the   government appears to have responded to the severe backlash it triggered. However, the way the withdrawal is being sold as a wise move by the prime minister smacks of a conspiracy to deflect some of the criticism aimed at the government. The   came late Monday evening and was welcomed by immediate angry responses from several senior journalists. Information and Broadcasting Minister Smriti Irani also engaged with some senior journalists on twitter on the issue.By Tuesday morning, newspapers, news television channels and news websites had already come out with sharp responses. An “emergency meeting” of journalists had been convened at the press club in Delhi to deliberate on the notification.  Soon, Irani indicated scope for review through two tweets, inviting “journalist body or organisation/s” to give suggestions to fight fake news and “uphold ethical journalism”. Within less than half an hour of those tweets, some journalists and media organisations broke the news about the withdrawal of the notification, on Twitter. Interestingly, these updates specifically mentioned the PM having called for withdrawal of the notification. There was no formal word from the PMO or any other government department that it was the PM, specifically, who wanted the order rescinded.   came out with a formal announcement only about an hour later, but even that release did not mention the PM. “PIB Press release titled “Guidelines for Accreditation of Journalists amended to regulate Fake News” issued on 2 April, 2018 stands withdrawn”, it merely stated. It appears that an attempt is being made to distance PM Modi from the controversy. Theses attempts suggest that Irani's ministry may have issued the controversial notification without the PM's consent and when the latter got wind of it, he quickly got it recalled. If that is indeed the case, that would be a first for this government which is said to have been always been in Modi's tight grip. Throughout the National Democratic Alliance's (NDA) four years in power, the government, its ministers as well as the ruling party have given the impression that PM maintains his watchful gaze on every move, every individual, every file and every noting in the government. Are we now being asked to believe that Modi's grasp on the government is loosening? Are Cabinet ministers now exercising autonomy and announcing measures without discussing them with Modi? Interestingly, it was way back on 17 March that Irani had first revealed the government's intention to take steps to regulate fake news. She had talked about only online content then, saying the Modi government was working on a “code of conduct” and possibly a legislation too. “Online is an ecosystem where legislation in terms of news, legislation in terms of broadcast content material, is not very clear. That is something that the ministry is currently undertaking, and in conversations with stakeholders”,  . In any case, Modi government's media strategy has been clear from a long time, wherein the PM will not interact with the press, his ministers and party spokespersons will face the press but will be dismissive of critical questions, media organisations will be controlled or nudged to take a pro-government and anti-opposition line and public service broadcasters will relentlessly air government propaganda.  The I&B Ministry's now-withdrawn order appears very much in sync with this strategy, even if fear of a backlash has made the government go back on it. It is the government, and not any particular minister, that stands exposed. The beast has bared its fangs once, it can do the same again and it might not withdraw them the next time.

382,Akash Bisht,"In an unprecedented show of solidarity thousands, may be lakhs, of activists who work for Dalit and Adivasi rights and supporters took to the streets in various cities across the country on Monday amid the call for an all-India shutdown. They were protesting the watering down of a central law to prevent atrocities against the underclasses by the Supreme Court. The demonstrations were not all peaceful. Media reports claimed at least eight protestors were killed, most of them in police firing, drawing sharp criticism from Opposition parties. Hundreds were reportedly injured or detained. One television grab showed a civilian too opening fire in Madhya Pradesh.Apart from MP (six deaths), the situation was particularly tense in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan (one death each). Widescale protests were reported from Punjab, Odisha and Jharkhand, affecting normal routine. There were demonstrations in Maharashtra too. Bahujan Samaj Party supremo   and Congress chief   came out in support of the Bandh. In Capital New Delhi, protestors were seen in small groups at several places, apart from bigger protests at Rajghat and Parliament Street, where his correspondent was present. Hundreds of protestors gathered at the road leading to the seat of Indian democracy to raise concerns over the alleged “ ” of the provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They demanded that the Supreme Court immediately revoke its order banning automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the Act. Those gathered squarely blamed the  -led Union government for delaying the process of filing a review petition. Under pressure, the Centre did file a plea in the apex court. However, Chief Justice of India, Dipak Misra, refused an urgent hearing on a plea for stay and review of the court's previous ruling. Such was the anger among protestors that they forced Janak Chamar, a Dalit BJP Parliamentarian, to stop his speech midway and leave the venue. On stage, Chamar had only begun his introduction when protestors raised objections over his presence at the stage. Thereafter, KP Chaudhary, general secretary of All-India SC/ST Employee Federation, took the microphone and announced how the BJP is stonewalling Bhim Army founder Chandrashekhar Azad's bail. The crowd then started booing the saffron party with slogans such as “BJP murdabad (Down with the BJP)”, “dalit virodhi sarkar murdabad (down with the anti-Dalit government)” and “Modi murdabad (down with Modi)”, leading to Chaudhary asking Chamar to leave.  The Gopalgunj MP was heckled by protestors and had to seek police protection. Once he left, several people from the crowd came forward to shake Chaudhary's hands who said all Dalit MPs of BJP should resign from Parliament over the dilution of the Act. “If they don't then you know that they are betraying us,” he said.  “The BJP wants to take us back to the dark ages from where Baba Saheb uplifted us. Do you think that we should do a gherao of Supreme Court? Will you support us?” he asked the crowd. On hearing this, the crowd erupted and started shouting “yes” amid chants of “Jai Bhim”.  Thereafter, Chaudhary announced that the 'gherao' of the topmost seat of Indian judiciary on 9 April, which was greeted with loud cheer. He stressed that similar to these protests, the SC gherao would also be done voluntarily without the support of any political party or banner. Veteran politician and former JD (U) MP Sharad Yadav then took over and blasted the BJP government for trying to dilute the SC/ST Act and sought reservations for dalits in judiciary as well. “Ever since the BJP came to power, it has tried to suppress Dalit voices while their followers have unleashed fury on innocents belonging to the community. Under the BJP, the Constitution is under grave threat,” the veteran leader said.  Speaking on the BJP's defeat in Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-polls in UP, Yadav said the coming together of two regional parties have shattered BJP's confidence. “All political parties and organisations should leave their differences aside and come together to dislodge this anti-Dalit BJP government... Use your vote wisely in the upcoming elections to keep Baba Saheb's legacy alive,” Yadav said.  Prodded by the crowd to raise the issue of malfunction of electronic voting machines, Yadav said EVMs should be scrapped and the use of ballot paper should be brought back to end all speculations. Once he finished his speech, the crowd began shouting SC/ST/OBC unity zindabad.  Thereafter, many speakers stressed on the need to vote BJP out of power to ensure a life of dignity for Dalits. Ashok Kumar, general secretary of All-India SC/ST Railway Association mentioned how the nation wide bandh was not led by any individual or political party and should continue as it is.  “The BJP government and other institutions have been trying to trample the Constitution and deny Dalits their rights. It is shocking that the SC passed such a judgement and what is even more shocking is how the government is delaying the process of filing a review petition,” he said.  The event was attended by a large number of youths from far-flung areas. Even they were extremely critical of the Prime Minister and repeatedly said his government was denying Dalits their rights.  “My request to the SC and the government is to restore the SC/ST Act. We have been facing so much discrimination that it was a nightmare for us to visit police station or tehsil. Because of this Act, the police and government employees were forced to take cognisance of our issues but if the SC remains adamant on its order, we won't be able to approach anyone. This will be a travesty of justice,” said Hanuman Prasad. The 28-year-old made a long journey from Tonk in Rajasthan to the Capital after hearing about the protests in Delhi. “Look how this government has failed to provide employment to crores of the youth in the country. What happened to all the promises of acche din. If these are the acche din than I don't want them,” he added.  Among others present were Ajay Dutt,   MLA from Delhi's Ambedkar Nagar, who claimed that dilution of the Act would lead to increase in atrocities against dalits across the country. “I request the SC to review its order so that Dalits are not denied their rights,” Dutt said.  A letter was also sent to the President by those at the forefront of the protests, requesting him to issue instructions to review the SC order.  “The BJP government and the institutions for the past few years are constantly attempting to destroy Social Justice that is guaranteed by the Constitution. Instances like Unna, Saharanpur are the evidences in front of us that how the respective governments and the courts are handling the matter. It is time for us to unite and fight against the Caste ridden institutions to ensure Justice, Liberty and Equality (sic),” read the letter.  Later in the day, Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi, on behalf of the RSS, said the SC's stand was unfortunate but the Sangh was wrongly being associated with that. Reportedly, BJP chief   called several ministers to discuss the issue.",2018-04-02 19:58:00+05:30,, Landmark Dalit mobilisation underscores resentment against Modi government | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
383,Charu Kartikeya,"It has taken   (RSS) a full election cycle to distance itself from a slogan that has been at the core of the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) strategy right from 2013. Coming as it does at a time when the shadow of the next Lok Sabha polls is looming large, the timing of the latest statement by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat is pregnant with implications. Speaking at an event in Pune, Bhagwat reportedly said phrases like Congress-mukt Bharat are “political slogans” and are “ ”. He also elaborated that the slogan smacked of “political discrimination” and the Sangh never uses “the language of excluding anyone”. Bhagwat's pitch for political inclusion is likely to have been received with much surprise in the Sangh Parivar's own political circle. It was in 2013 that the BJP's then prime ministerial candidate   coined the slogan “Congress-mukt Bharat”. The Congress was the route of all evils in the country and therefore to uproot it was the need of the hour, he said at one of his election rallies, in Pune, in July 2013.Modi went on to reiterate the slogan in several subsequent speeches and it eventually became a part of the lexicon of all BJP leaders. The PM still stands by it and used it once again as recently as in February, in Parliament. Bhagwat's attempt to distance RSS from a slogan Modi holds dear is therefore a significant moment. It indicates, at the very least, that RSS and the BJP are not on the same page in terms of a key political strategy. The slogan has always been slammed by political leaders as well as analysts, because it betrays an unusually vindictive campaign. India's political arena is a hotly-contested space, with three dozen parties represented in the Lok Sabha. Many more exist at local levels and many others are registered with the Election Commission, fighting for recognition and space. Parties vie with each other, criticise, attack and try to demolish each other's campaigns. However, seldom do they wish for the annihilation of the rival. Most of them realise that the existence of a rival fuels their own existence and spread. Non-Congressism is an old concept but even that campaign did not call for the end of the Congress party. The Congress too has never expressed a desire to see the end of a rival party. This was possibly the first time that an openly exclusionist campaign was carried out. Notably, RSS didn't intervene so far and has decided to speak at a time only when several indications of a weakening of the BJP's and Modi's grasp on the national consciousness since 2014 are appearing. The BJP lost three critical Lok Sabha bye-polls; the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) just lost one of its oldest constituents (Telugu Desham Party); another ally is breathing down its neck ( ) and two others are openly flirting with the Opposition (Lok Janashakti Party and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party). The government's failure in timely appealing for a review of the Supreme Court's order amending the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Cruelty) Act has led to massive protests against the BJP. The all-India shutdown called by several Dalit organisations created unprecedented pressure on the government. At an event connected with the bandh in New Delhi, a Dalit member of Parliament from the BJP was not allowed to speak and was hounded out of the venue. What could possibly be the motivation behind the RSS adding another pressure point on the BJP in such circumstances? Could it be that the RSS is smelling a decline in the fortunes of the BJP under Modi and is preparing for a post-Modi order?

The party is gearing up to launch a series of agitations – its tried and tested way of connecting with the masses. The party will target governments at both the state and the Centre on various issues including: Hyper-local protests and agitations on issues concerning the common man propped the   up ahead of the Punjab Assembly polls to an extent that at a point it seemed poised to top the race. One-to-one contact that AAP volunteers and supporters established made it strong at the grassroots. Before that, even in the 2014 General elections, hard work on the ground fetched the party four Lok Sabha seats from the party in the face of the Modi wave. But over-ambitious and over-confident leaders squandered those gains away. Wrong moves included proximity to Sikh hardliners and dabbling in Panthic affairs – things that are not the forte of AAP.  Now, a year before the next General elections, a meeting of zonal presidents, general secretaries, joint secretaries and Halqa in-charges Sunday decided to return to agtations. In the meeting Singh said volunteers were the backbone of the party and their opinion would be given utmost importance for appointments at every level. Also, AAP would work on maintaining discipline within the party and nobody would be allowed to cross the lines.  Four resolutions were passed unanimously, the primary one on AAP's resolve to fight drug dealers and their protectors. The party accused all its rivals – the  , Shiromani Akali Dal and   – of shielding those involved in the trade. The party demanded the state acts on a special task force (STF) report. AAP members also blamed the three rivals parties for continuing large-scale suicides by farmers and farm hands. The party criticised Amarinder for not uttering a word on the report submitted by a state Assembly committee on the issue, and demanded his government immediately releases compensation to the affected families.  Paying tributes to the 39 youngsters dead in Mosul, 27 of whom were Punjabis, AAP demanded compensation and jobs for their families. The party said successive governments were responsible for widespread unemployment that forces the youth to migrate to other countries despite threat to their lives. The AAP leadership also passed a resolution blaming the two current and previous governments have been for chit fund frauds over the years. It demanded the government mortgage properties of companies that cheated people and compensate affected families. Will these pay off? Observers feel AAP needs to reach out to people at the earliest and regain their faith that has been sliding over the last one year due to disturbances within the party.

385,Rajeev Khanna,"The Vijay Rupani-led   (BJP) government in Gujarat is likely to face another Dalit upsurge, with the community deciding to intensify its movement for land rights. Dalits, tribals and the poor in Gujarat are largely alienated from land and the state government is under scrutiny for lack of policy implementation. A public meeting of representatives from various districts of Gujarat is been organised on 19 April at Dalit Shakti Kendra near Ahmedabad on the issue.  “The self-immolation of Bhanubhai Vankar in Patan was the manifestation of frustration that the marginalised sections of society has been going through after prolonged and unsuccessful struggle to establish their rights over land, especially Dalits,” Dalit activist Martin Macwan said. Due to illegal occupation, in many villages Dalits are yet to get possession of waste land that they were given by the government, activists alleged. Several government resolutions have underlined that despite instructions district revenue authorities are not serious about removing such encroachments.  The activists shared one such resolution from 5 October, 1990, according to which: “It has come to the notice of the state that the encroachments on the government land has been increasing with passing days. On asking for information on encroachment of such land by districts through GO letter of 8/4/1988, it has revealed that in many districts the more than 10% of land has been encroached upon.  “In four to five districts, such encroachment has been over 40% or more land. This is extremely painful which suggests that the local revenue authorities are not sensitive to their duty of protecting the government property and in some cases, they have been purposely overlooking such realities.” Other resolutions acknowledge the fact that while giving legal possession of land to members of the scheduled castes, revenue authorities do not care to check whether or not such allotted land is free from encroachment.  Macwan said there were many cases of the poor losing part of their land or not being able to locate their allotment and blamed new GPRS-based technoloy, which has replaced traditional manual land surveys.  Dalit activists pointed out that under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, in grievous cases (murder, forced migration etc) victims are to be given agricultural land; but the policy has not been implemented. There are increasing incidents of burial land being allotted to Dalits. Most complaints relate to local authorities alienating Dalits from their land on general observation for violations of grant conditions known as 'Sharatbhang'. Macwan disclosed that even when the state has not given the actual possession of the land, authorities take away the same land under the rule that the land given for the purpose has been violated. It is being pointed out that such issues faced by the marginalised have never been collated and addressed. Individuals trying to protect their land against well-organised campaign of the powerful elements to dispossess them ends only in despair. Corruption is another obstacle for the poor to protect the land. Activists claimed that a third of the atrocities on Dalits and tribals can be traced back to land. Legal cases have been awaiting disposal even after three decades and more. Applications by poor to get government waste land for agriculture in accordance with the state policy are addressed through holding 'Land Kacheri' (revenue courts). “This has not happened for many years in the state. In rural areas especially, there is enormous problem of getting housing plots but the same cannot be addresses as the state has failed to allocate land for housing even when it has land but such land is under encroachment. This process too has to happen in Land Kacheri,” Macwan said. The participants coming for the proposed public meeting understand that the tension around the land issue is the result of non-implementation of the state policy. They believe that while the state becomes a mute spectator to massive encroachment of government land, the tension is intense between various sections of the society. The activists have chalked out demands. They want the government to not dispossess them further for Sharatbhang until all pending alienation cases are resolved. They also seek that the state set up exclusive courts to deal with the land issue in order to resolve them in a time-bound manner. There is a need for the state to declare a time table of holding Land Kacheris to address the issue of granting land to the landless and allocate land for housing. It will be demanded that the state must hand over possession of land to tribal community and settle all disputes under the Forest Act in accordance with the agreed state policy. In addition to this, it must give agricultural land to victims from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes of grievous atrocities in accordance with the law. The Rupani government will have to tread a cautious path in dealing with the issue as it cannot afford to alienate both Dalits and tribals in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

387,Anurag Dey,"Amid Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu’s efforts to garner support for the no-confidence motion against the  -led government, the   (BJP) dismissed his charges of the Centre ignoring the development of the southern state. Having quit the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre, Naidu's Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has been on the offensive against the Modi government over the demand for special category status to Andhra.  Campaigning in the national Capital, Naidu met key Opposition leaders including Congress’ Veerappa Moily, National Conference President Farooq Abdullah, Nationalist Congress Party’s Sharad Pawar, Trinamool Congress' Derek O’Brien and Delhi Chief Minister  . Besides in interviews to TV news channels, Naidu in a media conference in Delhi, accused the Centre of betraying the people of Andhra Pradesh. “I wanted to communicate to the nation about what they promised and what they have done, how they are attacking a state,” Naidu said.Subsequently, the BJP refuted Naidu’s charges and ridiculed him for his attempts to seek support from the Opposition. Taking strong exception to his allegations, senior BJP leader and Union minister   claimed the Union government went out of its way to help rebuild the bifurcated state.  “One should not be going to an extent to say that BJP is attacking Andhra Pradesh. We don’t even attack our erstwhile friends in unfriendly manner,” he said. “It is painful to hear him say that the TDP got at least 15 seats less (in 2014) because of its alliance with the BJP. If it was not for the Modi wave and the alliance with the BJP, wonder where the TDP would have been now. This is not the way to indulge in such a blame game,” he added. “  had already explained him about how the government has gone out of its way to help the state. From investment of Rs 1.4 lakh crore in the petroleum sector and Rs 70,000 crore on highways, to providing and fast-tracking clearances for building Amravati and the Polavaram irrigation project in the state,” Javadekar carried on, referring to Shah’s letter to Naidu. The BJP National President in his letter last month said the TDP quitting the NDA was “unfortunate” and refuted charges of his party being insensitive to Andhra's aspirations. In response, Naidu said Shah’s letter was “full of false information, which reflected their (BJP) attitude”. Reiterating the Centre’s commitment towards the development of Andhra Pradesh, Javadekar ridiculed Naidu’s politics. “All have the right to take a political stand, all can do politics , but please don’t pursue he politics of distrust. We (BJP-TDP) fought together against the Congress and now you are holding meetings with them. “It is painful to see the fallout but there should be a limit to political acrimony. All this blame game with political motive is rubbish. People will eventually realise who has done what. We have done everything for Andhra Pradesh and will continue to do,” Javadekar said. BJP spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member GVL Narasimha Rao blamed the Congress for Andhra’s plight and warned against the possibility of the TDP aligning with the Congress. “The Congress is solely responsible for the plight of Andhra Pradesh. The state was bifurcated in a manner detrimental to Andhra region and taken without any consideration of the future of the state. “Who they ally with is their call and we have nothing to say. But if they go with the Congress, then Naidu will be perceived as a rank opportunist. If he allies with the Congress then Naidu will lose whatever credibility he has left,” Rao said.",2018-04-04 23:48:00+05:30,," BJP targets Chandrababu, asserts Centre's commitment towards Andhra | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

393,Catch Team,"In view of the rise in cross-border firing between India and Pakistan on the Line of Control (LoC) and the International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir, the Concerned Citizens’ Group (CCG) decided to visit some of the affected area and also hold discussions with prominent opinion makers in Jammu and in Srinagar.  The Group comprised Yashwant Sinha (former Union minister for finance and external affairs), Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Kapil Kak, Sushobha Barve (executive secretary, Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation) and Bharat Bhushan (journalist). Wajahat Habibullah was unable to join due to pressing personal commitments. Yashwant Sinha was unable to accompany the group to Srinagar and Uri. The primary rationale of the visit was the escalation of cross-border shelling which assumed a new intensity since the beginning of this year. The ceasefire understanding reached between the two countries in 2003 was violated with impunity with small arms fire giving way to heavy mortar and finally, even artillery.  The unusual escalation resulted in a high death toll – the casualties in January 2018 alone equalled the figure for the entire 2017. And 2017 itself was an exceptional year for ceasefire violations, as they represented a six-fold increase compared to 2015.  The huge collateral damage to civilians living on both sides of the border was therefore also not unsurprising. On the Indian side alone more than 40,000 civilians had to be evacuated, make-shift camps set up to house them at a safe distance, economic activities disrupted and schools closed in the areas adjoining the IB/LoC. Besides the loss of human lives, houses were destroyed and damaged, cattle killed and injured and local water and electricity infrastructure disrupted. The group believed that the situation in Jammu, fast deteriorating into a communal divide, also needed to be looked at. The rape and brutal murder of an eight-year-old Muslim Bakkarwal girl, Asifa, was being used to fan communal passions by local politicians. Within the Kashmir Valley, despite the success of the security forces in eliminating top militant leaders, the recruitment to the militant ranks was on the rise with even highly educated youngsters choosing to pick up the gun. Militancy in the Valley also seemed to be changing qualitatively with fidayeen attacks taking place. Suicide attacks were unknown in the Kashmir Valley earlier. People have been making a connection between the heating up of the LoC and terrorist attacks in the state by terrorist proxies of the Pakistan Army. The argument goes that by using terrorist proxies, the Pakistan Army distances itself from terrorist attacks and pays no price for its subterfuge. The ‘robust’ response of the Indian Army this time around, it is said, is meant to punish the other side by specifically targeting Pakistani Army posts. Militancy in the Valley, however, also seems to have developed an autonomous raison d’etre in the absence of any political dialogue. The group wanted to understand the changes that had taken place in the Valley since its last visit and understand whether there were any moderating influences that could prevent youngsters from taking up the gun.In Jammu, the group visited the affected villages of Bera, Jeora Farm, Kapurpur on the IB (Pakistan calls it ‘Working Boundary’). It also visited the Suchetgarh Border Post on the Jammu-Sialkot Highway, following a flag meeting between Pakistan Rangers and the Indian Border Security Force.  The next day the group visited one of the villages on the LoC called Ganiah in Nowshera sub-division of Rajouri, which had witnessed frequent cross-border shelling. It also met villagers evacuated from some other villages adjoining the LoC – viz. Khamba (Jhanghar), Sair Makri, Kanet, Sarya and Anwas-Bhandar. The evacuated villagers met the group in a delegation led by the “LoC Border Migrants Committee” at Nowshera. The group also had discussions with prominent citizens of Jammu on the prevailing situation in the state. The group also made a visit to Uri and met people evacuated from the villages adjoining the LoC in the Haji Pir sector. These villages included Churanda, Hathlanga, Saura, Sillikot, Tillawadi, Balakot and Garkot. In Srinagar, the members of the group met Lt. General AK Bhatt, 15 Corps Commander, some prominent representatives of trade and business, a group of public intellectuals, and a member of the J&K Legislative Assembly. The CCG was shocked to see the devastation caused by the increased frequency and intensity of cross-border shelling. While the resilience of the border villagers who are collateral victims of the increased tension between the two countries is remarkable, it was shocking to find that no long-term strategies were being devised to alleviate their suffering. Even the short-term measures seemed ad hoc and patch-work at best.  The inhabitants of the border villages deserve to live in peace and security like their compatriots elsewhere in the country. However, they seem to have become itinerant migrants in their own country – evacuating their homes periodically to live in make-shift camps with their livelihoods disturbed by the deaths of their family members, losing limbs and getting wounded, their homes and hearths destroyed by the shelling, their cattle killed and maimed, and their children’s education disrupted.  These 'migrants' whether they are on the International Border or on the LoC have certain clear political views and equally clear messages for the two governments. They also have specific demands which need to be taken into account by those who take them for granted as routine victims of the hostility between India and Pakistan.  The CCG was also disconcerted to find that while the situation in the Kashmir Valley had deteriorated further, even the peace in Jammu had become fragile. It was concerned that Jammu was being communalised for narrow political gains by certain political groups and forces. In addition, the specific issues concerning the displaced community of Kashmiri Pandits as well as the refugees from West Pakistan who came to Jammu in 1947 were not being addressed adequately. The entire length of the IB and the LoC is fenced. However, intruders from Pakistan slip into India in connivance with Pakistani security forces either by cutting the fence, damaging the fence by firing or using fenced areas which get washed away by floods.  This time around the IB has seen greater shelling by Pakistan than earlier. Experts ascribe the intensity of firing to both calibre escalation – with larger calibre weapons being used – and revenge escalation. When India pounds Pakistan from LoC areas where it is better placed militarily, Pakistan retaliates from its advantageous positions on the border. Strategic Affairs experts claim that the Jammu border also becomes hot because Pakistan knows that the border villages around the IB and LoC segment in this region have a significant number of Hindu population – if they force the migration of Hindus from the border villages, it hurts the government in power politically. However, the prevalent view is that in most cases the damage caused to the border villages is collateral and most of the cross-border shelling is primarily aimed at the border posts of the two sides. Mortar shells are not precision-guided and it is the shells that go astray which hit the villages adjoining the border or the LoC.  Whatever be reasons for either side heating up the border or the kind of ammunition and weapons used, it is the villagers who live in the adjoining area who suffer. The villages abutting the IB in Ranbir Singh Pura (RS Pura) are almost used to mortar shells hitting their homes. There are any number of houses with walls pock-marked by shrapnel in these villages. In one such village, Bera, a young farmer had died while he had gone to his fields when a mortar shell hit him. The CCG members were also told that about 50 unexploded shells were still lying around in and around peoples’ homes – the Bomb Disposal Squad of the J&K police had not had the time to defuse them and remove them safely since January this year. The exchange of fire across the IB has been particularly severe in 2017-18. Locals say that the cross-border firing mostly used to take place in September-October every year and mostly at night. However, this year the firing has taken place in January also and during the day. Death can come to these villagers unannounced. Earlier, the villagers used to evacuate their homes at night and come back to tend to their farms and cattle in the morning. Now with day time firing from Pakistan, even that is not of much help. People can die while doing the most mundane things – during their morning ablutions, while praying, working in their fields or even just loitering in the streets. The cross-border firing has been so intense this January that many villagers complained that they could not even cremate their dead locally and had to take the bodies all the way to the Ranbir Singh Pura crematorium. In some other villages like Jeora Farm, which is barely 100 metres from the IB, while no villagers were killed, the death toll of cattle – buffalos, horses, sheep and goats – has been huge and economically crippling for the local Gujjars. In this predominantly Muslim village, most people rear animals and house them in thatched mud-walled cattle sheds. More than 200 cattle have been killed in the cross-border shelling over four days from 19 to 23 January 2018. In addition 24 thatched houses have been destroyed and 27 damaged. Since then, most villages spend the night in a make-shift camp at Chakroi at a safe distance from the border. They go back only during the day to look after their cattle.  There are two community bunkers in the village built by the state government. They are meant to shelter villagers during cross-border shelling. However, these are used only at night by 6-7 villagers who stay back to guard their property. The situation on the villages adjoining the LoC in the Jammu region is much worse. Unlike the villagers adjoining the IB villages, this area seems to have seen much more frequent cross-border firing. These villages have been subject to intermittent shelling in the months of March, May, June, July, August and December 2017. They were shelled once again quite intensely in January and February 2018. The group visited Nowshera, which accounts for a 68.5 km of the LoC. According to the district administration, 23 out of the 59 villages in the Nowshera sub-division are situated adjacent to the LoC. Since 2016, in Nowshera 12 of these villages with a population of about 13,100 have been severely affected by shelling from across the LoC.  The villages where there has been a loss of human lives and which have witnessed property and cattle damage are: Khamba, Sarya, Bhawani, Kalsian, Manpur, Dhanka, Bhojnava, Kalal, Khori, Ganiah, Pukharni and Anwas-Bhandar. Of these, four villages – Khamba, Bhawani, Sarya and Anwas Bhandar – are beyond the fencing on the LoC. The details of the damage suffered by these villages are considerable. There have been four deaths, eight villagers have been injured, 124 houses damaged, 189 livestock lost and 189 injured, three school buildings destroyed, one Panchayat house and one cattle shed destroyed due to shelling from Pakistan. Other collateral damage includes the destruction of water reservoirs and distribution system, transformers, electric poles, conductors, insulators, transmission lines and cables. Several heaps of stored grass have also been burnt. The villagers have been evacuated to make-shift camps being run in government schools at a safe distance. There are six such camps in Nowshera and an additional 44 camps have been kept ready in case the situation on the LoC deteriorated further.  The district administration has done an excellent job of providing basic facilities -- conveyance, boarding, proper accommodation, food and other essentials, medical care, potable water as well as uninterrupted water supply for other daily needs and sanitation for the displaced villagers. However, this clearly is not a permanent solution. The villages adjoining Uri had been peaceful for the last 8-10 years. However, this year Uri has seen several ceasefire violations. Truth is the first casualty on the LoC when ceasefire violations take place. Each side blames the other for starting the shelling. However, many local observers claim that the cross-border firing in Uri is a response to Pakistan’s shelling in Poonch, Rajouri and Ranbir Singh Pura. They surmise that the immediate provocation for the heavy exchange of fire across the LoC in Uri on February 20-24 was the killing of a Border Security Force trooper on 20 February in the Tangdhar area of Kupwara district by Pakistani firing. India is believed to be at a distinct military advantage on the LoC segment in Uri. According to local officials, no artillery was fired from the Pakistan side in the Haji Pir sector in Uri this time around, although artillery has been used by them in other areas on the LoC. The villages in this sector have been hit only by heavy mortar shells. The Indian Army, however, is believed to have used artillery to respond to Pakistan. Some of the villages adjoining the LoC, especially close to the Haji Pir nullah, are beyond the border fencing on the Indian side. These include Churanda, Hathlanga and Saura which are entirely beyond the border fence and others like Sillikot and Tillawadi lie on both sides of the fence. Most of the inhabitants of these villages are nomadic herders and their grazing ground lie inside the fence - ie towards Uri. The border fence is gated and these gates remain open during the day from 9 AM to 5 PM.  These people live under constant fear of becoming collateral victims of any exchange of fire on the LoC. Besides, the border fence is locked down during the shelling and this traps them in the direct line of fire. The gate in the fence itself is made a target by the Pakistan army during cross-border firing, making it impossible for anyone to open the gate and allow the villagers to move to safer areas. The distance between some of these villages on the Indian side and those on the Pakistan side is often as little as 20 metres.  In Uri, about eight villages housing about 7,000 people have been affected by the cross-LoC firing. About 1,500 people from these villages have been evacuated. While nearly half of them were put up in rehabilitation camps at four educational institutions in Uri and NHPC quarters in Kanderwan, the rest found shelter with their relatives in the area.  The CCG members met several villagers from the villages which have been evacuated frequently – in 1992, 1997 and then now in 2018. They claimed that this time around there were no casualties but that a woman had been injured due to shelling and about 30 houses in Churanda, 22 in Sillikot and 2 in Tillawadi had been damaged. A few animals have also been reportedly injured. However, a detailed assessment of property damage by the district administration was yet to take place due to the ongoing stray exchange of fire when the CCG members visited Uri. In the past, several people have lost their limbs in the shelling but fortunately that has not happened this time around. Most villagers have no complaints against the Army, dependent as they are on it for employment as porters, masons and casual workers. They are often also dependent on the Army for medical facilities and food supplies. Most of their land has been acquired by the Army for the construction of border posts and the acquired land adjacent to the ‘Zero Line’ on the LoC has been mined to prevent infiltration. The villagers claimed that up to 2009, they used to be paid rent for the land acquired by the Army but since then all rental payment has stopped. The district administration says that it has submitted plans to the state government for building 3,500 bunkers in the villages adjoining the LoC in the Uri sector. However, the situation of the villages beyond the border fence is such that building bunkers will not help them. They want land to build homes at a commuting distance from their villages so that they can cultivate their fields, tend their fruit trees and look after their cattle during the day. Most importantly, they want a permanent solution to stop the cross-LoC exchange of fire. When cross-border shelling starts intermittently, the local administration as a measure of abundant precaution shuts down schools in villages adjoining the International Border and the LoC. Often students get trapped in schools when shelling takes place and have to be rescued by special rescue teams. While this may be necessary to ensure the safety and security of the students, it jeopardises their education by disrupting it frequently.  Although the administration does run make-shift schools in the camps housing the villagers and their families, they are also impacted by the disturbed situation. The net result is that the students from the border villages do not do well in their school exams. In the Nowshera sub-division, for example, 71 schools falling within the 0-0.5 km range of the LoC have been shut down. In Uri too LoC village schools have been closed. The same is the case with schools in villages along the IB in Jammu. These children with frequently interrupted classes then find it difficult to compete with their peers who attend schools that run regularly and on a fixed academic schedule. The net result is that their parents then demand that their disadvantage of being from border villages be taken into account to give their children ‘grace marks’ to pass their exams. This obviously cannot be the long term solution to the problem of frequently disrupted classes and shifting schools. In case of death due to cross-border shelling, the locals get compensation of Rs 5 lakh each from the central and State governments and Rs 1 lakh from the Red Cross. The family of the diseased has the choice of not accepting monetary compensation and opting instead for a government job for the next of kin of the dead under the state government’s Special Rehabilitation Order (SRO). For those who are wounded, the maximum compensation is Rs 75,000 per person with the minimum being Rs 5,000. After the visit of a team from the Union Home Ministry in November 2017 to J&K, the compensation rates were revised under the State Disaster Response Fund or SDRF. These rules have been applicable since December 2017. According to the revised scheme; the compensation for animals killed is fixed based on the type of animal eg Milch Buffaloes are compensated at Rs 30,000 each, the other – non-milch, at Rs 25,000 each, goat at Rs 3,000 each, sheep at Rs 4,000-6,000, and chicken at Rs 80 each.  There is no limit set for the compensation and individuals can get compensation for each animal/bird killed. The group met a villager who had lost 15 buffalos in the shelling overnight at Jeora Farm who claimed that a buffalo costs between Rs 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh in the market. Even if this is an exaggerated estimate, his compensation of Rs 30,000/per animal is unlikely to put him on the path of economic recovery. The primary demand of the villagers in the border is that India and Pakistan should resolve this issue through an immediate dialogue.  Time and time again the villagers told the group that “either resolve this through dialogue or through a decisive war which settles the issue once and for all (‘aar-paar ki ladai’).” This is not a call for war but a reflection of their desperation and helplessness where they become involuntary victims of the conflict between the two countries.  There are mature voices also among the residents of these border villages. Many believe that war is no option. “Don’t give ‘munh-tod jawab’ (jaw-breaking reply) to Pakistan from here because then we, who live on the border, are the sufferers. Give a tough reply from Delhi or Mumbai,” one of them said. Another said: “We think that the solution to this problem is ceasefire. India and Pakistan should come to an understanding on maintaining peace on the LoC as they had done earlier. That worked for a decade or more. But for that they have to sit across the table as in today’s day and age it is impossible for either side to capture and hold onto the territory of the other. Stop tough talk with mortar shelling, talk to each other.” However, their immediate demands can be summarised as follows: People in Jammu felt that the exchange of fire on the IB and the LoC should not be seen as localised activity and emphasised that it had wider ramifications for the state. When violence erupts in the Valley, Jammu does not remain untouched and the reverse can also be true. The wider contours of the India-Pakistan conflict, they said, had started impacting individual thinking and perceptions besides the direct impact it has in the border areas. There was a general consensus that when no dialogue seemed possible between India and Pakistan, civil society organisations had a role in taking initiatives to address the issues confronting the people and mere Pakistan-bashing was not going to help. More importantly, there was perception among the local citizens that in the coming days the situation in Jammu was likely to become difficult to handle. The growing disappointment with the state government and increasing communal divide could make the situation in Jammu quite provocative. The Kashmir Valley has been on the boil off and on but the Jammu region becoming politically volatile is a new phenomenon. The religious divide in the state has clearly been deepened in recent years as communalism has taken deep roots. People point out that even the Courts in Jammu and Kashmir are divided – the two benches in Jammu and Srinagar gave differing rulings on unfurling of the state flag, for example. This has caused fissures in the state’s social stability.  The latest issue that has flagged the rise in communalism in Jammu is the brutal rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim Bakkarwal girl, Asifa, in Kathua allegedly by a Hindu. The attempt apparently was to frighten and evict the nomadic Bakkarwals from the land they occupied. Some local leaders of the   (BJP) along with an outfit called the Hindu Ekta Manch have taken out public rallies with the tricolour in hand shouting slogans which suggest that Muslims are pro-Pakistan and need to be dealt with swiftly. A prominent local Muslim businessman summed up how he felt saying, “I belong to Jammu and have never felt unsafe here. But now even I have started feeling insecure. What am I to make out of the Hindu Ekta Manch taking out a protest march waving the national flag over the Asifa rape case shouting: “Those who want Pakistan will be sent to Qabristan (burial ground)? The only person who needs to be sent to Qabristan is the rapist. Even in the case of a rape, we are totally divided. This is frightening.” The communal divide in Jammu is being promoted by politically ambitious leaders who are intent on tearing apart the rich and diverse social fabric of the region for their short-term political benefits. Some prominent citizens, however, lamented the fact that local civil society organisations had not countered the communal narrative surrounding Asifa’s rape and murder. Others said that there was no civil society in Jammu and that the space for civil society’s activities had been taken over by communal politicians. Not only is Jammu getting polarised communally, even the State Legislative Assembly has been polarised after the terrorist attack on the Sunjuwan army camp. Increasingly the perception is that there is a ‘Hindu Jammu’ ruled by the BJP and then there is ‘Muslim Kashmir’ ruled by the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) – i.e. there is a communal division of labour between the two political allies which govern the state. Many believe that the PDP-BJP government thrives on communal divisions by promoting polarising voices to represent the sentiment in Jammu and in the Valley. This divides and alienates people. This was described as ‘soft separatism’ by a public intellectual. Many felt that there was a need to contest the separatist narrative or even a communal ‘Jammu narrative’. It was suggested that a beginning could be made not only by civil society demanding justice in the Asifa rape case but also through institutional means such as focussing on school education -- including lessons about local heroes in school curriculum and making school prayers and activities inclusive.  There was local resentment that the central government seemed focussed only on the Valley because of the separatism there and ignored Jammu. The growth in Jammu had become hostage to the concerns about the Valley, they claimed. There were complaints that projects that should have rightfully come to Jammu are implemented in the Valley because the militants there had picked up arms. Whatever be the truth about the causes of resentment in Jammu, what was clear was that the central government needed to pay attention and balance the demands of the people from all the regions of the state – Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. The Kashmiri Pandits would like to go back to the Valley but have no homes to go back to as their homes are either sold or badly damaged. Although the Kashmiri leaders know these facts; they insist that Kashmiri Pandits must go back to their original homes. As a result their issue remains stalemated. Kashmiri Pandits who had gone back to the Valley after taking up government jobs under Prime Minister’s Employment Scheme apparently were under pressure, not from the locals, but from their kin in Jammu to return.  However, were there to be second migration of these Kashmiri Pandits from the Valley, the crisis in the state may become even more intractable. It would seem that Kashimiri Pandit politics has become quite complicated and there was a need to understand how their issues could be resolved through amicable political methods. The representatives of the West Pakistan refugees argued that there was an urgent need to address their issues too. They are not ‘state subjects’ and are therefore denied certain rights that other inhabitants of the state enjoy. They cannot get employment with the state government, they cannot buy or own property and their children cannot get government scholarships.  Although they have been given limited rights to access education and health facilities, they essentially remain lesser citizens of the state. Their problems seem so intractable within the framework of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status within the Indian Constitution that no government has addressed them with any seriousness. There was unanimity on arriving at a consensus for resolving problems afflicting Jammu and the need to find a set of actionable issues on which there was a general consensus. On its part, CCG offered its services to civil society organisations in Jammu for extended discussions on the issues affecting the people and to identify the way forward. There was growing feeling in the Valley that politics had not worked in the state and that ceasefire or the lack of it made no difference. The hopes of the Kashmiris in Prime Minister   seemed to have been dashed. They had thought that he would carry forward the initiatives of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. However, now they felt that he has brought nothing but despair and disappointment in Kashmir.  As a result, the constituency for peace and peace-building through confidence-building measures (CBMs), elections and dialogue, has been eroded. Now even to suggest the use of these instrumentalities for peace is to invite derision. Despite its earlier enthusiasm, the local citizenry does not now place much faith in the frequent forays of the Home Ministry’s special interlocutor to the state.  In effect, the Modi government’s policies have pulled the rug from under the feet of those who did not support militancy, violence and radicalisation. It is this all-prevailing desperation that has given rise to militancy and people accepting the use of violence by youngsters. In South Kashmir the perception is that every youngster is a militant – the only difference is that some are armed and others unarmed. Militancy has also now spread to Srinagar. As for the Modi government’s Kashmir policy, there is a feeling that since it is unable to control terrorism, it wants its constituency to feel that India is effectively replying to Pakistan which is projected as the root cause of all problems in Kashmir. Under these circumstances the locals have internalised the fact that while violence in Kashmir will wax and wane, politically nothing will happen to address their concerns. What also seems to have added to the despair of Kashmiris is that they see little support from the Indian mainstream intellectuals and opinion makers. Even those who were never influenced by Pakistan see little hope when they look towards Delhi. The net result is that the social base for a robust relationship with rest of India has shrunk. This has also impacted the younger generation as they do not view any dialogue with Delhi with any element of hope. The younger generation of Kashmiris does not have the context of normal situation as they have not seen normalcy in their lives. Those who have seen militancy in the late 1980s and in the 1990s seem more worried today. Almost every youngster in the age group of 13 to 24 seems to be inspired by militant thought even if most of them are not picking up arms as yet.  This inspiration is not coming from Pakistan or its intelligence agencies but from local militant youth icons like the late Burhan Wani and now, Zakir Musa. Unlike in the past there is no moderating influence of parents, other family elders or religious leaders on them. As the state government is increasingly being seen as an extension of the regime in Delhi, a situation may come when the only link of the state to the rest of India would be through the security forces.

397,Akash Bisht,"On Day 1 of Indian National Congresss two-day plenary session in Delhi Saturday senior Congress leaders sharpening their attack on bete noire  . Former party president   took the lead, lambasting the   government for being power hungry. The “dramebaaz attitude” of the ruling dispensation will lead to Congress returning to power in Karnataka and that will provide a new direction to the country's politics, said Gandhi. “Backed by evidence, we are continuously exposing the fraudulent promises and corrupt practices of Prime Minister Modi and his associates. People have now understood that slogans like 'sabka saath sabka vikas', ' na kahoonga na khaane doonga' and his Man ki Baat on radio were just gimmickry and a trick to get votes and the chair,” she added. The results of the Gujarat Assembly elections and bye-polls in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh reflect that “those who wished to erase our existence had no clues that there is so much respect for the Congress,” said the leader.  “In the last four years, this government has made every efforts to destroy Congress without realising that it has and will never bow down to the arrogance of power,” she said amid cheers and applause by thousands of party workers who gathered from across the country. Urging the Congress workers to be ready to make sacrifices, she said: “ We need to struggle to make a India that is free of fear and intimidation. An India where each man can live with dignity. An India that is free of biases, vengeance and outcry.”  She also said her son Rahul has taken over the Congress presidentship at a very challenging time.  In his opening remarks, Rahul took pot shots at the BJP, claiming that attempts were being made to spread hatred and create divisions within the society. He highlighted how Indians were being pitted against each other and said: “Our work is to unite people.” Speaking amidst slogans of '  zindabad', the newly elected president said the biggest difference between the Congress and the BJP was that they use divisive politics while we use love and brotherhood. “I want to reiterate that this nation belongs to every religion, caste and person, and whatever Congress will do, it will do for the nation and no one will be left behind,” he added.  Taking digs at Modi, the Congress president said the youth of the country have lost hope and whenever they look at the Prime Minister, they don't see any hope of securing employment. “The nation is in a way tired and looking for a way out and I can tell you with all my heart that only Congress is capable of showing them a way,” he said. According to a political resolution passed, India's core constitutional values are under attack and freedom was in jeopardy with institutions under stress and their independence compromised. The political resolution particularly tore into the RSS for systematic assault on principles of Constitution and values of Indian republic.  “The RSS-BJP is misrepresenting, distorting and misusing religion to exploit the sentiments of the people and capture political power. The toxic mix of religion and politics, poses a challenge to our pluralistic society and inclusive democracy. RSS, which claims to be a social and cultural organisation, masquerades as sole representative of the Hindus,” read the resolution moved by senior party leader Mallikarjun Kharge.  It accused the BJP government of brazenly misusing the constitutional office of governors and resorting to unethical means to destabilise elected governments, hijack popular mandates and foisting governments by manufacturing majority. The resolution read: “Congress deplores the government for undermining the established norms of governance and subversion of educational, cultural and historical institutions, facilitating their capture by the BJP's ideological affiliates. RSS infiltration of every Institution, Administration and the Universities, poses a threat to pluralism and Indian Democracy. The centralisation of authority, arbitrary and partisan decision making, has cast a dark shadow on Parliamentary democracy.” (sic) The resolution demanded that to ensure the credibility of the electoral process, the Election Commission should revert to the old practice of ballot papers instead of electronic voting machines (EVM) as emulated by other democracies world over.  Until now, Congress had never raised the EVM issue from a party platform and this marks a major shift in its views over EVMs. “There are apprehensions among the Political Parties and the people over the misuse of EVMs to manipulate the outcome contrary to the popular verdict,” the resolution noted.  The resolution also dismissed Modi's idea of holding simultaneous polls and called it “impractical” and “incompatible with Constitution”. The party noted that if allowed, it could have serious implications which must be thoroughly “enquired into” and a national consensus be built around it. The party decided to adopt a pragmatic approach to co-operation with like-minded parties and evolve a common workable programme to defeat the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Earlier in 1998, during the Panchmarhi session, party leaders had unanimously decided to not allign with any party. However, five years later in 2003, the party decided to have an understanding with other like-minded parties which led to UPA coming to power in 2004. Meanwhile, the party also passed another resolution on 'Agriculture, Employment & Poverty Alleviation' wherein it made several promises to address these issues. For the farm sector, one of the most prominent promises of the party is to bring a loan waiver scheme for all small and marginal farmers on the pattern of the farm loan waiver program of the UPA govt in 2009 benefitting 3.2 crore farmers. Resolving to bring in a farmer centric paradigm shift in the Indian agriculture, the party accused the BJP of duping farmers by making empty noises of doubling farm income by 2022.  “The crop insurance scheme brought by the government has benefited private insurance companies more than the farmer as money is taken away from the bank accounts of farmers, without their consent,” read the resolution. Similar promises were made for creating employment and poverty alleviation during the first day of the plenary.",2018-03-17 19:32:00+05:30,, Scrap EVMs says Congress on Day 1 of Plenary.

398,Akash Bisht,"On the last day of Congress’ 84th plenary session, party president   gave a sneak peek into the roadmap that will help in building a stronger and more vibrant Congress to take on Prime Minister   in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Promising to deliver on the plenary’s theme of ‘Change is Here’, Rahul gave impetus on giving prominence to ordinary workers over veteran leaders to create a more robust Congress.  Speaking during the concluding session of the two-day plenary, the Congress president claimed that there existed a wall between the grassroots-level workers and senior leadership and that his motive was to demolish that wall to ensure representation of ordinary workers in the party. “We have to change the Congress. There is a wall between our leaders and workers. My first task will be to break that wall. I will consult senior leaders to destroy that wall with love,” he said.  His remarks were greeted by a thunderous applause and loud slogans of ‘Rahul Gandhi zindabad’ from the audience who had gathered in the national capital for the two-day event. In fact, this plenary was a complete departure from its previous avatars where senior leaders were seated on the dais. This time around the dais was left empty with all senior Congress leaders seated with the other delegates only separated by barricades. “Do you know why this stage has been left empty? It is because I want to see ordinary party workers to rise and take their place on this stage. In the past, we had leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Nehru, Sardar Patel and Subhash Chandra Bose. I want to create that Congress of the past where anyone can lead the party,” he added.  Moreover, what made this plenary stand out from the rest was how a lot of young leaders were given a chance to speak at the forum which was refreshing to see. In the past, senior leadership hogged all the limelight while young leaders were confined to the sidelines.  Citing example of the recently held Gujarat Assembly elections, Rahul pointed how involving Congress workers paid huge dividends. “When we gave tickets to Congress workers in Gujarat, Modiji was seen flying away in seaplane. When we truly empower Congress workers, PM Modi will be seen in submarine,” he added.  Meanwhile, during his 53-minute long speech, Rahul devoted most of his time making stinging attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP and the RSS. In a veiled attack on BJP President  , Rahul said, “People will accept a man accused of murder as the president of the party, but they will never ever accept the same in the Congress party because they hold Congress in the highest regard.” The 47-year-old was particularly critical of the Modi government and likened the prevailing political situation in the country to Mahabharata. Comparing BJP and RSS to Kauravas and Congress to Pandavas, he said, “Centuries ago there was a huge battle on the field of Kurukshetra. The Kauravas were powerful and arrogant. The Pandavas were humble and fought for the truth. Like Kauravs, BJP is designed to fight for power, but like the Pandavs Congress will fight for the truth.""  Labelling the Modi government as corrupt, the Gandhi scion said the people of the country hold Congress to a higher standard while the ruling dispensation is corrupt and controls the conversation in the country. Accusing Modi of colluding with crony capitalists, Gandhi cited examples of Nirav Modi and Lalit Modi and said “so what does Modi actually mean? It symbolises the collusion between India's biggest crony capitalists & PM. It is interesting that the man who looted banks, Nirav Modi shares a similar name to PM and the most corrupt man in Cricket also shares the same name Modi.”  Accusing the Prime Minister of diverting attention from real issues, he added that while farmers and unemployed youth suffered, Modi is asking people to do yoga. “There is no employment. Farmers are dying. And Modiji says, 'Chalo, India Gate Ke Saamne Yoga Karte Hain’.” He was particulalry critical of the RSS which he said was spreading fear and trying to subvert institutions like judiciary, Parliament and the police.  Speaking on the recent controversy where four Supreme Court judges decided to go to media to highlight certain issues, Rahul said, “People of India go to the courts for justice. For the first time, four judges of the Supreme Court had to come to the people for justice. There is a difference between the RSS and the Congress. We respect the country's institutions whereas they want to finish them. They only want one institution and that is the RSS.” Meanwhile, the last day of the session also witnessed former Prime Minister Dr   taking the stage and accusing Modi of making “jumla-type” statements. “I would only say that the BJP Government made tall promises. Modi ji himself said we will double farmers’ incomes in six years time. If you have to double farmers’ incomes in six years time, you need a growth rate of 12 per cent per annum as the minimum. And that is unthinkable. Therefore, it is one of those statements, which is merely a Jumla-type statement, which is not likely to be achieved and Modi ji himself recognises that these are tall promises."" The former prime minister also spoke briefly on the prevailing situation in Kashmir and accused the Modi government of mismanaging the region. “At the same time, we also must recognise that the Modi government has mismanaged the Jammu and Kashmir problem as never before. They have installed a government, where the two wings of the Government are working against each other. The atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir is deteriorating day in and day out,” he added.  The last day of the plenary also witnessed two resolutions on foreign policy and economy being presented. The resolution on economy was moved by former finance minister P Chidambaram who claimed that if the prevailing situation continues, it will witness the next government facing a major economic crisis. During his address, Chidambaram accused the Prime Minister of pushing people into poverty and claimed that the banking sector is in crisis because of mounting non-performing assets. Continuing his criticism of demonetisation and hastily implemented GST, the former finance minister said that these twin moves led to destruction of jobs. “One party which can pull this country out of crisis is the Congress party. I say that not out of arrogance, not out of conceit. I say that because we have done it before and we will do it again,” he stated. In an uncharacteristic combative mood, Chidambaram, whose son is being investigated on charges of graft, said how many of those present would have felt that he would not be speaking from the dais and even present the economic resolution. Congress also passed another resolution giving Rahul all the powers to constitute a new CWC. The previous CWC was disbanded in wake of the plenary session leading to speculations of CWC being elected through elections. However, that was not supposed to be as it took the party four minutes to give Rahul the absolute power to form his own team.",2018-03-19 00:53:00+05:30,, Congress Plenary Day 2: Rahul starts Mission 2019 | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
399,Ramakrishna Upadhya,"Internecine war between the ‘original’ Congressmen of Karnataka and ‘migrants’ from other parties, which remained suppressed for long, appears to have raised its head, with Veerappa Moily leading the charge. The veteran Congress leader is known for calibrated moves. But this time he took to micrologging website Twitter to launch a savage, albeit indirect, attack on Siddaramaiah. The Karnataka Chief Minister is considered a migrants’ leader in the Congress. With Assembly elections round the corner, leaders are vying to obtain tickets for their kith and kin. Supporters can come later. And in the Congress – a party where ‘dynasty’ is no cuss word – at least a dozen leaders are trying to gain lateral entries to electoral politics to their progeny.  Moily’s son, Harsha Moily is a serious aspirant for the Congress ticket from Karkala, which Moily Sr represented six terms, before moving to Parliament. At a preliminary meeting presided by the Congress high command’s representative KR Venugopal, leaders put forward their demands. Moily too batted for his son, saying Harsha had been cultivating Karkala for the past three years. But Karnataka Public Works minister HC Mahadevappa, a Siddaramaiah confidante, reportedly sneered at Harsha’s chances of winning and backed Uday Shetty, who had been with the party for over three decades. Veerappa Moily, who earned  ’s trust at the Centre, reportedly silently fumed at ‘migrant’ Mahadevappa’s jibe, but did not react immediately. But that night he set off a ‘bomb’ via his twitter handle.  “INC needs to solve money (problem) in politics. We can’t afford to have road contractors and their nexus with state PWD minister determine how candidates are selected for upcoming Assembly elections.” read Moily's issued around 10 pm.  He had tagged the   official Twitter handle along with those of party chief   and Karnataka Congress. It was retweeted by Harsha within minutes. The father-son duo set the media on fire, putting the Congress completely on the defensive. State BJP boss BS Yeddyurappa joined the tweet-war saying, “Moily is right. We have been saying Siddaramaiah is 10% (commission) CM. With contractors filling PWD minister’s deep pockets, state coffers and roads are in tatters. Cong veteran’s view validates our point.” Moily and Yeddyurappa have both been CMs of Karnataka in the past. Moily later joined the central Cabinet under  . It took Moily more than 12 hours to rebutt the argument and claim that someone else was managing his Twitter handle and the remark attributed to him was “not authorised”. He would never make such negative comments about the party publicly, he said. Harsha also issued a denial saying neither he nor his father was in social media and it had been done by a ‘third party’ who had sent it “without our approval.” Interestingly, they admitted that the comment had gone through their official handles, but neither of them retracted the content. Allegations of money power holding sway in Karnataka was nothing new. Just a few months ago, the Income Tax department recovered a diary from Congress Member of Legislative Council Govindaraj with details of around Rs 600 crore paid to central leaders from time to time.  Govindaraj is known to be close to Siddaramaiah. Investigation into the incident is on. What could have irked Moily more was that the state government has efffectivly sidelined old Congressmen like him in the last five years or so. Siddaramaiah and Mahadevappa joined Congress only in 2006-07.  The later has been aggressively promoting his son Sunil Bose. An internal party survey reportedly indicated Mahadevappa was on a weak wicket in his constituency, T Narasipur, and has planned to switch to CV Raman Nagar in Bengaluru. Bose then can debut from T Narasipur. Bose, who faces police complaints regarding illegal transportation of sand, was nurturing the constituency for some time. He has even been allowed to undertake development works on behalf of his father. He or Harsha are not exceptions. In fact, there is a long list of senior leaders in the Congress who are trying to push their sons or daughters into politics. CM Siddaramaiah has declared that his son Yatheendra will contest from his constituency Varuna while he will move to neighbouring Chamundeshwari.  The list includes other ministers like TB Jayachandra – who wants a ticket for his son Santosh Jayachandra – Ramalinga Reddy and Kagodu Thimmappa (for their daughters Soumya Reddy and Nandini) and Roshan Baig for his son Ruman Baig. The children of Assembly Speaker KB Koliwad, former deputy chairman of Rajya Sabha Rahman Khan and former Union minister Margaret Alva are also aspiring for Assembly tickets. Congress has received about 2,000 applications for the 224 Assembly seats. Wherever it ignores loyal and experienced partymen to accommodate influence-peddlers, it will face rebellion from within. Rival parties may also snap up such rebels. Senior Congress leaders admit that in 2008, the party lost about 30 seats, thanks to bad selection of candidates. Then party observer Prithviraj Chavan expressed dissatisfaction about the role of ‘money power’ in Karnataka and declared that if Congress lost the election, it had nobody to blame but itself. In 2008, Karnataka opened its doors to BJP for the first time, allowing Yeddyurappa to become the first southern BJP CM. In a tight contest, as every seat is going to be crucial, Congress sources say that Siddaramaiah might withdraw his son Yatheendra’s nomination, forcing other aspirants and their backers not to press for tickets.  By taking a high moral ground, Siddaramaiah would be killing two birds with one stone as he would not only brighten chances of Congress emerging the single-largest party, but he would also avoid the risk of shifting to Chamundeshwari, which intelligence agencies reportedly believe is “not very safe” a seat for him.",2018-03-19 19:06:00+05:30,, Moily's tweet points to a deeper problem in Karnataka Congress | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

The two strong CMs emerged hopeful off the meeting at Nabanna, the Bengal state secretariat. The discussion seemed to have centred around a new political alliance and both expressed satisfaction at a “good beginning”.  “Leaders come out of situations. The federal front will be different from traditional models of political alignments... There is a need for a qualitative change because of the emerging economy. The front will glorify the masses of India,” he said.  “There may be some political parties with different viewpoints and some may share ideas. Some parties are friends, some enemies,” said Rao, who was accompanied by two party parliamentarians K Kavitha and K Keshav Rao. Banerjee said: “I maintain good relations with all parties... We both expressed our views; let us discuss take it forward. We are not in a hurry.” According too the Bengal CM every regional party has its own strength and possibilities need to be discussed. “We should approach other  political parties and eventually a consensus will come among all political parties,” she said. “Politics is a continuous process. As we love India as a nation, we should think how to deliver better,” Banerjee added.  Praising her Bengal counterpart, Rao said: “I came here 13 years ago. There has been tremendous development under the leadership of chief minister Mamata Banerjee. She has transformed Bengal.” Stressed the need to find political alternatives, he said:”We do not follow the model prevalent for the last 71 years. New policies and ideologies are needed and we have to re-orient ourselves to new ideas.” Rao was not the first leader Banerjee has met. Last week former Union minister Praful Patel of Nationalist Congress Party called on her at the same venue. He said Banerjee and his party chief Sharad Pawar found a need for an immediate meeting of like-minded political parties to form an alternative platform to counter the BJP at the Centre.  Opposition parties will meet in New Delhi on 27-28 March.

401,Rajeev Khanna,"The alleged scam regarding the purchase of medicines and equipment at inflated costs for public hospitals in Haryana has the potential to increase the  's problems before the Lok Sabha elections next year. It can also mar re-election chances of the Manohar Lal Khattar government. The allegations came Sunday from Dushyant Chautala of Indian National Lok Dal, who represents Hisar in Lok Sabha. Khattar's government bought implements, medicines, cotton rolls, face masks, pregnancy strips and hand sanitisers at inflated cost in Rewari, Hisar, Fatehabad, Rohtak and Jind districts, Chautala alleged citing information received through the Right to Information Act. The civil surgeon in Fatehabad procured face masks for Rs 4.90 while it was available there for 95 paise only, Chautala alleged. Similarly, 500 gram cotton rolls were bought for Rs 140 each but they could have been purchased at Rs 99 at the tender rate. Digital blood pressure costs were Rs 1,600 – more than double of Rs 780 normally. Hand sanitizers (400 ml) procured for Rs 325 could have been bought for Rs 185. Some blood collection tubes were procured for thrice the market rate from a firm in Hisar whose owner is in jail for minting fabricated coins. “The firms, shown in the RTI-stamped papers, from which the medicines or equipment were purchased, do not exist,” Chautala said. “One company from which medicines were purchased is registered to sell daily-need items. In another case, the address of the firm turned out to be that of a washer man’s shop,” he added.  The purchases were under National Health Mission and Mukhya Mantri Muft Ilaaj Yojana. Three firms were shown operating from the same address in Hisar and Fatehabad. In Rewari the purchase committee obtained six drugs from a Hisar firm that does not have license to supply drugs. It was also supplying drugs to Fatehabad. The INLD alleged that instead of deciding on suppliers through tendering, quotations were invited only at the level of civil surgeons. In Rohtak, it alleged, procurements worth Rs 3 crore were done without any committee being formed. RTI papers show no signature, date or letter numbers in such. According to Chautala, state authorities were reluctant to part with information, which was eventually obtained after the intervention of Punjab and Haryana High Court. “Rewari was a classic case of denial of information. They gave over 5,000 pages of information. All the papers were photo copies of electricity bills of hospitals. But one page was related to the purchase of medicines. This page turned out to be the tip of the iceberg,” Chautala reportedly said, underlining that it took his party around a year to collect information. The INLD has pegged the scam at Rs 125 crore in the five districts alone and apprehended it could go up to more than Rs 300 cr. The party demanded that the matter be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij has already recommended that the Comptroller and Auditor General look into the matter. The state government distributed Rs 87.60 cr under Mukhyamantri Muft Ilaaj Yojana and National Health Mission from 2014 to 2017, of which only Rs 40.89 cr was spent, Vij said, questoning the INLD's Rs 300-cr claim. Vij said civil surgeons have been directed to purchase products online. Calling Chautala's allegations “baseless and misleading” he contested the allegations district wise armed with his own set of papers. The minister claimed face masks in Fatehabad 2,000 triple layer sterilized masks were bought through e-tendering at Rs 4.90 each. The 1,000 masks mentioned by the INLD were common ones that cost 95 paise a piece. Some observers pointed out that irregularities under health schemes were nothing new in Haryana, particularly in remote districts. However, what remains to be seen this time is whether the INLD is able to make an electoral issue out of it.",2018-03-20 18:23:00+05:30,, Haryana medical scam: Will the opposition succeed in making it a poll issue | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

403,Charu Kartikeya,"With just about a year left for the term of the current Lok Sabha to end, heavy churning has begun in political corridors. The latest bye-polls in Uttar Pradesh were an early indicator of this churn. A large number of other key signals are coming from Bihar. Bihar also saw bye-polls, along with UP, for one Lok Sabha and two state Assembly seats, but two noteworthy events had happened before the bye-polls. Former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi left the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and joined the anti-BJP camp and a sidelined IPS officer with a particularly communal past was made the state police chief. These two events were indicative of two broader narratives playing out in Bihar, which has continued after the bye-polls too. One, the BJP appears to be asserting itself over the state government, in a bid to emerge as the leading player on its own. Two, its other National Democratic Aliance (NDA) allies, including the governing   (United), have realised this and have started scouting for options and back-up plans. Let us look at five other developments that have taken place after the bye-polls and let us try to understand what they seem to be indicating.  – It is true that Manjhi's Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) is not too big a player in the state, with just one MLA in the state Assembly. However, the part commands a vote share of 2.3% that can come in handy in a rainbow coalition. His exit, therefore, indicates a definite shrinking of the NDA in Bihar. Manjhi was never comfortable with Chief Minister  , having fought with the latter bitterly over his own removal as CM. He was said to be unhappy with the BJP's decision to welcome Kumar back in the NDA and eventually moved out after realising that he wasn't being made a part of the NDA government in Bihar. Union Minister and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader Upendra Kushwaha harbours similar misgivings towards Kumar, having left JD(U) to create RLSP after a bitter fall-out with the latter. He has also been reportedly uncomfortable with Kumar's return to NDA. Though, on record, Kushwaha has denied any plans to quit NDA, sources say his statement is an eye-wash and he is only waiting for the right moment to make a move.  – KS Dwivedi, recently appointed Bihar DGP, was SP in Bhagalpur during the 1989 riots and the state government's commission of inquiry into the riots had made adverse comments about his role (http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bihar-govt-tells-critics-why-it-made-k-s-dwivedi-dgp-5083405/). Opposition parties have alleged that he was appointed at the BJP's  . BJP also appears to be working on a polarisation campaign in Bihar, as is evident from recent incidents in Bhagalpur. The town saw a communal clash on 17 March over a Hindu procession that passed through a Muslim-dominated locality reportedly without police permission. Police has lodged a   against 20 people in connection with the violence and those named include BJP leader Arijit Shashwat, the son of Union Minister Ashwani Choubey.  Another controversy is brewing over the beheading of the father of a BJP leader in Darbhanga. Several BJP leaders, including state BJP chief Nityanand Rai and Union Minister Giriraj Singh, had alleged that the victim was killed because he had led the renaming of a local square in the name of Prime Minister  . However, CM Kumar and the state police have asserted that the beheading took place over a  .   – Kumar also appears to have started signaling discomfort with the BJP. The state police's case against Choubey' son and the CM's assertion in the Darbhanga case that it was the result of a land dispute are all being seen as indications of a counter-assertion on his part.  Interestingly, he has also said in the wake of these incidents that he will not compromise on the maintenance of   in the state. This is being seen as his veiled message to the BJP to stop its campaigns.   – Union Minister and Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan recently sprang a   when he commented on the BJP, for the first time ever in last four years. After the BJP leaders' comments on the Bhagalpur and Darbhanga were reported, Paswan hit out at BJP and urged the party to pursue a secular agenda. He also said, “We ought to look carefully at how Congress remained in power in the country for so long, enjoying the support of Dalits, Brahmins and Muslims without actually doing anything for them.”. Many are looking at Paswan's statements as the definitive indicator of changing equations in the state. Sources in Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress told Catch they were indeed looking at Paswan's statements as a concrete indicator that he was reading a change.

406,Rajeev Khanna,"Grappling with continuing attacks on minorities and their institutions, various Muslim organisations in Gujarat are trying to find a way out. Around 400 representatives of various social organisations gathered in Ahmedabad Sunday to take stock of the situation, its graveness and to discuss the road ahead. The gathering discussed how the Gujarat model of communal violence has spread to other states like Jharkhand and Rajasthan, said Mujahid Nafees, one of the organisers. Also, the cauldron of hate was being kept alive in Gujarat's remote parts from where objective reportage is difficult to emerge, he added. “Four dargahs in Kutch district have been desecrated in the last two months. We took it up with the Director General of Police (DGP) and cases were registered against unknown persons. But nobody has been arrested,” Nafees said.  “Also, the the roof of a temple was demolished. We have called for prompt investigations into the incident. These can lead to full-blown communal violence across the state,” he added.  Kutch has otherwise been known as one of the most peaceful districts but efforts to disturb that has been seen at regular intervals. The fact that the district borders Pakistan can help the agenda of perpetrators of communal violence. Meanwhile, hate messages continued unabated on social media across the state, activists said. Sustained communal campaign against Muslims in Gandhinagar district's Chhatral area left one youth dead while his mother three of her digits.  Shamshad Pathan of Alpsankhyak Adhikar Manch points out that in Mehsana district's Kadi region vitriolic social media posts have been doing the rounds that some Muslim boys from a local school has been harassing Hindu girls.  He said Hindutva organisations were trying to break the Dalit-Muslim cohesion that has emerged in these parts. Hindu fringe groups want to ensure a 'Gharwapsi' of Dalits, he added.  Hindutva organisations are widely believed to have used Dalits to target Muslims during the 2002 violence. But their social and economic conditions have led to Dalits and Muslims co-existing in poorer parts of Gujarati cities and towns. True, many Dalit and Muslim ghettoes came up in big cities after 2002, but there still remain slums, mainly in small towns and villages, where they continue to live side by side. “Things need to be looked from a larger perspective. They are now targeting small towns and villages,” Pathan said. “  (BJP) leader Vinay Katiyar's recent call for sacrifice for Ram temple in Uttar Pradesh can't be looked in isolation. The BJP came to power on the development plank in 2014 but has failed miserably. So it now wants to return to the temple issue that fueled its growth in Gujarat in the 1990s,” he added. In fact, many Muslims have expressed fears of a communal flare up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Sunday's convention passed a resolutions apprehending such fears and seeking early redressal.  They expressed particular concern over the continuing 'deeksha' programmes by Hindutva organisations where tridents are being distributed. The first resolution passed seeks an immediate end to such events and arms training. The second resolution was regarding the government adhering to the recommendations of the Sachar Committee so that the Muslims are able to get rid of their various fears and apprehensions. The participants demanded a Minorities Commission be set up in the state, with powers of a civil court. They also demanded that a Minorities (Prevention of Atrocities) Act be enacted for ensuring their safety and security. Alleging that there was a deliberate attempt across the country to destroy the livelihood and businesses of Muslims, the participants said Muslim organisations need to come together to send a strong message. “Next week we will hand a memorandum of demands to the governor. We will also demonstrate during the next Assembly session. We want want to make this a national issue,” Nafees said.",2018-03-21 18:38:00+05:30,," Grappling systematic communal assault, Muslims try to find a way out | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

408,Charu Kartikeya,"The Delhi High Court landed a surprise judgement Friday, setting aside the disqualification of 20 Members of the Legisltive Assembly from the Aam Aadmi Party ( ) for allegedly holding offices of profit. In doing so, the court quashed the Presidential order disqualifying the legislators. The court ruled that the Election Commission (EC) did not follow principles of natural justice while holding proceedings in the case, by not inviting the MLAs to put forth their  . The court has now sent the matter back to the EC for holding proper hearing. This does mean that the case is still alive as the court has not commented on the merits of the case. However, the setting aside of the disqualification will come as a major embarrassment for not just the SC, but President   as well.  EC's action was always suspect, President made matters worse. It was in June 2015 that Delhi-based advocate Prashant Patel had petitioned then President   to disqualify 21 AAP MLAs for allegedly holding parallel offices of profit.  Earlier that year, Delhi Chief Minister   had appointed these MLAs as parliamentary secretaries, a position that Patel alleged was an office of profit. Mukherjee had then referred the case to the EC for its opinion, which the latter then took nearly two years to formulate and provide. The EC submitted its opinion quietly on the last working day of the retiring chief election commissioner in January 2018. President Kovind   by displaying undue haste, issuing disqualification orders on a Saturday, which were made public on a Sunday.  Constitutional experts had flagged concerns then itself, pointing out that EC had not followed due process of law by not hearing the MLAs. PDT Achary, Former secretary-general of Lok Sabha, had then   he was at a loss to understand how the EC had given its final recommendation without hearing the MLAs.Since the High Court has not cast any aspersions on the merits of the case, the case still stands. The EC will be required to hear the case again and give an opportunity to all the 20 AAP MLAs to present their arguments. However, there are two other concerns at hand that have also been flagged earlier and deserve a mention again. In September 2015, the Delhi high court had struck down the post of parliament secretary itself, ruling that the appointment of the MLAs on the posts was unconstitutional, because the LG had not given his assent. This led the AAP to argue that since the appointment itself was quashed, no office-of-profit case arose. Achary supported the contention and noted that the High Court ruling meant that the MLAs had served as parliamentary secretaries not even for a moment as the very posts were declared unconstitutional. Achary had also pointed out that once the issue became a legal one, the case should have been heard by a court of law as EC is not an authority that can decide on a legal issue. These concerns are likely to come up again. In whatever manner the case progresses from hear on, the latest ruling has shown the EC as well as the office of the President in negative light. Patel, the petitioner advocate, whose pro-Hindutva inclinations are clearly visible on his twitter time-line, is finding it hard to respond to the ruling. In an earlier tweet, he had implied that Delhi HC will uphold the disqualification of the MLAs and Delhi will see by-elections after that. Following the ruling, he said he had just raised a constitutional issue and there was no setback for him. The petitioner's background suggests that this case does have elements of conspiracy and the HC ruling has established that EC and the President too played along.  It is time for both the sullied institutions to make amends and take steps to ensure the restoration of their image as non-partisan defenders of the Constitution.",2018-03-23 17:23:00+05:30,, HC verdict on 20 AAP MLAs is a major embarrassment for EC & President | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
409,Priyata Brajabasi,"Even as Jawaharlal Nehru University grapples with sexual harassment charges against Atul Johri, a fresh issue of sexual misconduct has come to the fore. The Delhi High Court recently issued multiple notices over a petition by a JNU student who alleged that Mahendra P Lama, a professor harassed him for helping another student who faced sexual misconduct by him. That's not all. According to sources, Lama faces sexual harassment charges from two female research scholars too. Lama is with JNU's Centre for South Asia Studies (CSAS) under School of International Studies (SIS). In the first case of the petition, filed by Prashant Kr Sharma, the high court on 20 March sent notices to:  They were given a week to respond. Petitioner Sharma is pursuing a PhD from CSAS. He reportedly helped a female research scholar who escaped from China after alleged sexual harassment by Lama when the two were there as part of a research team on 17 October, 2017. Sharma told Catch that since then Lama and Kharat harassed him – his synopsis was not cleared and his registration for the new semester in January was stalled.  “He had no choice but to move court as he was being repeatedly harassed by the accused,” Sharma’s lawyer Dibyanshu Pandey told Catch. “Sharma is from a poor family and he is being threatened that he would not be allowed to complete his PhD because he helped the student escape,” he said. He also alleged that he was repeatedly asked to dissuade the female student from making an official complaint to JNU's Internal Complaints Committee (ICC). She, however, did complain and an investigation is underway. Her supervisor was also changed.  Lama, however, was not suspended or restrained from taking classes. He is also on the panel for admissions for the upcoming academic session. In January, ICC received complaints of sexual harassment complaints against Lama and Karat from two more students. They were also being supervised by Lama for their thesis.  An e-mail by one of the two students, addressed to Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar among others, went viral recently. Excerpts: “I write with regards to the complaints that I have registered with ICC on 8th January 2018. I had registered a complaint of sexual harassment against Prof. M.P. Lama and Prof.Rajesh kharat.  ""The two professors have not been restraint from going to SIS building and the Centre for South Asian Studies. Moreover they are on the panel of interviewers in the on going admissions process. Why (have) such people have been interested with such responsibilities pending multiple inquires against them in ICC? ""I hereby request you to remove Prof. Mahendra P. Lama and Prof. Rajesh Kharat from the interview panel of CSAS immediately and suspend them until inquires reach its logical conclusion. There are strong possibilities that if they are not removed from the panel and suspended immediately, the inquiry will be influenced.""  None of the female complainants approached the police, unlike in Johri's case. On the campus, students affiliated with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad alleged that the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) and the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) were shielding the accused professors. “Large-scale have taken place against Prof Johri, who is a supporter of the VC. But there is no mention of Prof Lama as well as Prof Karat and Prof Pathnayak who are shielding him... You can see the hypocrisy of the Left,” Vinay Kumar, ABVP's JNU wing president, told  .  Former JNUTA president Ayesha Kidwai refuted the allegations. “The Atul Johri case reached prominence because of police complaints were registered due to the incompetence of the ICC... It is the incompetence of the ICC due to which the said professors have not been found guilty or suspended and they are still part of the panel of interviewers.” She said as ICC doesn't divulge identities nobody knew about the cases against Lama and Kharat. There was no response from a representatives of the JNUSU, which was involved in a scuffle with Delhi Police on Friday over protests regarding Johri's case. On his part, Patnaik said the comlainant never approached him and denied having any influence over ICC.

413,News Agencies,"The opposition, led by Leader of Opposition Takam Pario walked out of the state assembly in Arunachal Pradesh late on Monday night (March 12), charging the government of Chief Minister Pema Khandu with being voiceless and ineffective. Prior to its walk out, the opposition walked into the Well of the House to protest. It was the first time an incident of this nature has happened in the political history of Arunachal Pradesh. The opposition was voicing its dissent over the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the state government and the Education Development Corporation of India Ltd. (EDCIL) to set up 1500 smart classes in secondary and higher secondary schools at a cost of Rs.30 crore under the Chief Minister's Adhunik Sikshya Yojana programme.

Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein, however, defended the move, saying that the signing of a MoU was permissible as per budgetary provisions.

""The opposition will support all good works of the government, but they must be free from corruption. Every member has equal rights in the house. The allocation to each assembly should be made public. Why party baji only"", Kamin questioned. Kamin said, ""If we don't demand here, where we will demand? The government is for the public. If the public has no rights, where do they go? Is this democracy when the opposition is not allowed to speak? We all are elected like the treasury bench members.

416,Akash Bisht,"The political circle was still not done analysing the election results in the Tipura, Nagaland and Meghalaya when Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu dropped a bomb by withdrawing the two Telugu Desam Party ministers from the Centre. The focus quickly shifted to the demand for special status for the southern status, which was split in 2014 to form Telangana. The split had been a highly imotive issue that was demonstrated by the way the Congress was decimated in elections then. While Naidu's TDP, allied with the  , made a killing at the hustings, Jaganmohan Reddy's Yuvajana Shramika Ryuthu Congress Party kept its share of the pie with six of the state's 25 Lok Sabha seats. It also emerged as the chief Opposition party in the state Assembly despite a slew of corruption cases against Reddy, the son of former chief minister YSR Reddy. On hindsight, his decision to split from the Congress paid off and now the party is back in focus with political turmoil reemerging in the state. Catch spoke to Midhun reddy, a prominent parliamentarian from YSRCP over Naidu's deicison, special status and what lies ahead. Edited excerpts: A: It is a classic case of posturing in the wake of the upcoming Assembly elections in the state. Since the TDP has gone back on all its promises, it just want to blame the BJP and quit the alliance. Chandrababu Naidu is trying to drag this till the end because he is scared he might get into trouble being with the NDA. He is under tremendous pressure back home. The YSRCP has been mobilising support over 'special category status' for the last four years. Now, Naidu has realised that people have understood that he isn't serious about it. Earlier, he would say that the special package was good and if you would talk about special status he would threaten to jail you.  Since public pressure mounted on him, he made a U-turn. All educated people are inclined towards special status. Now he wants to put the blame on the BJP so that only it suffers from the anti-incumbency.  Anyway, what difference does it make if two junior ministers resign? Only if they resign as members of Parliament and go for byelections, it would pressure the government.  Take the case of Rajasthan: just after the BJP lost the by-polls, it announced loan waiver. Would it have done so if it would have won with a huge margin? Everybody, including the finance minister, has been misguiding us. See, the Andhra Pradesh Re-organisation Act, passed in the house, is different from the special category status.  This package they are talking about is part of the Act. Two things were promised. They are just picking up things from the Act and saying this is the package.  Currently, the state is in such a financial mess considering that the debt on Andhra Pradesh since Independence stood at Rs 90,000 crore and in these 3.5 years it has increased by Rs 1.3 lakh crore. If it goes on like this then we will have even more debt considering we still don't have a state Capital. Yes. All revenue that united Andhra generated was from in and around Hyderabad. People fancied Hyderabad so much that they didn't develop other cities. All development was concentrated there. So, when the state split, Telangana became a surplus state while Andhra suffered.  There is no state capital; if you go there (Amaravati), there is just a board and large swathes of empty land. Why would anyone come there to invest or live? In four years nothing happened. they gave Rs 2,500 crore for the capital, the chief minister did nothng except displaying graphics.  Look at the Bengaluru Vidhan Sabha; it was built in just three years. Naidu has wasted four years. He took land from farmers without paying them a penny and called it 'land-pooling'. These farmers are in distress now because as they can't farm. It's a mega scam: all the land surrounding the capital belongs to Naidu and his party men. We have already declared that on 6 April our Parliamentarins will resign and seek re-election on the issue of special status vs special package. Then Naidu will know. Why should his ministers resign? He wants to put pressure, but will the resignation of only two ministers make any difference?  We also said “Let's all fight together. Let us put politics apart and ask all 25 MPs to resign.” Just imagine that there were by-elections and the BJP got a drubbing – it woul be disastrous for its 2019 plans.  The support we are getting for infrastructure development is not enough. We might need a similar package next year. Then again we will have to go go beg whosoever is in power. If we get special status, industries will come and we won't have to beg each year. Why should we run after them? We have clearly said any party that supports our demand would get our support. Let Mamta didi come or let Left Front form the government and we will support them if they help us with special category status. We are not bothered with national politics. We are interested only in the special status.  We will not enter any pre-poll alliance, but support any party who can take our agenda forward. Only if they are in that situation. but it is unlikely. At her peak   offered Reddy a central berth and asked him to not leave the Congress. He still did and hence the cases. Reddy knew he would be harassed. It's just vindictive politics. It is almost like arresting Rajeev Gandhi for allegations against Rajiv Gandhi in the Bofors case. In most of the cases, the court has adjudged that the officers, ministers and industrialists named were not involved. How is it that then only Reddy was in the wrong? He never signed anything, but was jailed.  Look at Naidu: his voice is on record, trying to buy one of our legislators. All channels aired it where he could be heard asking the MLA to “be free in asking what you want”. That was three years ago, but nothing happened. How is the chief minister above law?    This is also a reason why he is not quitting the NDA – there are lots of corruption cases against him. Probably, because it thinks that in the number game, Andhra is negligible.  Also, if they give us the status, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha might get upset lots of industries will shift to Andhra if there are benefits. Our huge coastline makes us conducive for business. But these are poll-bound states it wants to win. In Tamil Nadu it doesn't have much of a stake but they are a strongest Opposition in Odisha and Karnataka. Even in West Bengal it is giving a tough run to the Trinamool Congress. We want to win at least 20 of Andhra's 25 Lok Sabha seats to be in a position to bargain. If you look at the 2014 elections, the BJP with the Modi wave, the TDP and actor Pawan Kalyan were all there; still their vote share was just 1.2% more than ours. The difference of all votes polled was only about 5 lakh. They have gone back one every promise and we want to exploit that. Our tenure ends on 4 June, 2019. That' 15 months away. For more than a year's time frame, the Election Commission has to announce by-polls. We have been raising this issue for long. But with only six Mps, it was not projected well enough at the national level. But we have won the perception battle in the state.  Well, he wouldn't have been arrested. But electorally, we would have sunk with the Congress. People are still angry with the party for splitting the state. We will play a key role at the Center, considering the BJP will not be as strong as it is. I don't think it will have an absolute majority.  We will certainly play a role.

426,A Saye Sekhar,"Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao is nursing two ambitions:  1) Playing an active role in the national political arena, and 2) Passing on the baton in the state to his son KT Rama Rao. It's more than a week since he announced his intent to foray into national politics with a strong desire to bring about a “qualitative change” in the polity and people’s lives. Though KCR himself claimed that some national leaders have hailed his idea, support hasn't been pouring in as much, at least, overtly. It isn't known whether he is in touch with some leaders worth their salt, already.  But the Chief Minister's Office has informed the media two days after his announcement that he would undertake a tour of important cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Bengaluru; hold parleys with social harbingers of social change and professionals and experts in various walks of life not only to enlist their support, but even to elicit their views on various issues impacting people's lives. KCR, chief of the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), is a long-term player. He has a lot of political patience, thanks to Telangana agitation. A man who fought a protracted battle for 13 long years to realise his ambition of the formation of a separate Telangana State cannot be described as a man in a hurry.  So, he may take his time in embarking on his mission, 'Jai Bharat', a slogan that he concluded his address with on the second day of his announcement in front of a specially convened public meeting on the lawns of 'Pragathi Bhavan', the official residence of the Chief Minister. One interesting quality KCR has is that he wouldn't hesitate to admit mistakes. But he must feel the compunction and it cannot be externally taunted. If he does, he has no qualms about retracting. Fueled by confidence – for now it appears to be just a bravado – that there is a scope for the emergence of an alternative political conglomerate to the Congress and the BJP-led coalitions at the national level, KCR began to make the first steps. He actually is dreaming big and the haze around the seriousness of his objective to don the national mantle is slowly disappearing what with his repeated assertions. On Sunday, KCR chose the TRS legislature party meeting at the Telangana Bhavan, the party’s headquarters, as the platform to announce that he “would be here (in Hyderabad) until 2019 only. After that, I will play an active role in national politics.” KCR has always maintained that he has no problem with the BJP and Prime Minister  . Though he did not wax eloquent on Modi, he stretched to the extent of saying: “Indian politics are now in need of the TRS. Modi has developed Gujarat and then went to Delhi. Since I developed Telangana, my aim is to raise the banner at the national level. The idea of a national alternative hasn’t taken birth now.” What does he mean by this? Is it that just in case, his mission fails to achieve the desired result, would he be angling for a better negotiating power with Modi? For the record, KCR asserted that the Congress and the   (BJP) could make no difference to India in decades of their rule. KCR's idea of a fast-track growth and his grandiose plans to take a cue from China and Singapore models of development and willingness to amend the Constitution, if it warrants, signal his intent in bringing about a paradigm shift in politics and administration.  While he scored a few brownie points by proclaiming the “first-mover advantage” to spearhead the national alternative, which he refuses to call a ‘third front’ but as the ‘first front’, would he be able to cobble the diverse political formations will become interesting to watch. Another strong ambition he is nursing is to pass on the baton in the State to his son, KT Rama Rao. Whether the idea of playing a crucial role in national politics triggered the thought of creating a succession plan back home or is it the other way round is, however, not clear. But KCR has almost anointed his son KTR to be his successor. He has dropped ample hints to this extent at the TRS Legislature Party meeting.  “Rajya Sabha elections are very crucial. I am entrusting the responsibility to KTR. He will have to coordinate with Deputy Chief Minister Kadiyam Srihari, Finance Minister Etela Rajender and Power Minister K Jagadeesh Reddy. And the most important matter of the Assembly session will be managed by Legislative Affairs Minister Harish Rao.” By hinting that he would take “efficient leaders” along with him to Delhi, KCR literally cleared decks for his son to don the mantle here. For, KCR’s nephew and Irrigation Minister Harish Rao, a very senior leader in the TRS, is also a strong contender for the top job in Hyderabad. In fact, grooming the son for the big role has begun two years ago. KTR was given the onerous task of leading the party in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Elections (GHMC) in 2016. The TRS scored an overwhelming victory in those elections trouncing the Congress (two seats), the BJP (four) and the TDP (just one).  The TRS scored a whopping 99 out of 150, its ally All India Majlis-e-Ittehaadul Muslimeen won 44 in those elections. KTR also led the TRS to a victory in a byelection to Paleru Assembly seat in Khammam district. KCR’s heir apparent has systematically fortified his support base, independent of his father, by making use of the free hand given, across the state.  With 1.1 million twitter followers, KTR, who holds five important portfolios of Information Technology, Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Industries, Mines & Geology, Handlooms and Textiles, and NRI Affairs in KCR Government, is the most active politician on social media too. He is smart and affable when it comes to demonstrating sophistication – he moderated a session with Ivanka Trump, Cherry Blaire and Chanda Kocchar at Global Entrepreneurship Summit held towards the end of 2017 with great elan.  He is tough and rustic in striking a nativity cord and connecting with people when he addresses public meetings, which are a bright indication to his future role. He succeeded effortlessly in hogging the limelight when it comes to portraying himself as a leader with a humane heart. More often than not he demonstrates his humanitarian concerns to people by extending medical help or providing employment avenue or shelter to at least three cases that draw his attention through Twitter every day. He is highly active on the microblogging site and uses for taking political potshots, issuing administrative instructions etc. Does KTR have a plan of action to combat the growing opposition and high-decibel anti-establishment campaign by the Congress and the outfit led by Joint Action Committee leader Kodandaram is, however, a million-dollar question.",2018-03-14 18:30:00+05:30,, KCR is ambitious alright.

The residual state of Andhra Pradesh with all shortcomings and disadvantages it had to carry, had been under utter neglect.”  Reminding party leaders of former Prime Minister  's assurance of providing special status to the state, he goes on to add that it was ratified by all Opposition parties, including the   (BJP), back then.  He highlighted that back then BJP leader   had categorically requested for the grant of SCS for 10 years with the contention that five years would not be sufficient as setting up any industry itself would take three-four years and that benefits should be extended to a longer period.  In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while campaigning for the General Elections in the state, had promised SCS to Andhra for a period of 10 years to ensure sustained development and prosperity. Moreover, the promise of SCS was also included in the state manifesto of both the BJP and its ally Telgu Desam Party (TDP) as well. Jagan alleges that once the BJP managed to form the government, it tried to dilute the SCS issue and instead started talking about Special Financial Package with the “blessings of Chandrababu Naidu”. Further accusing the TDP of not pressurising the central government enough to push forward the SCS demand, Jagan listed various reasons in his letter for not giving Andhra SCS. He pointed how it was denied to the state following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission despite 11 other states receiving the status.  Accrording to him, two commission members – Abhijit Sen and M Govinda Rao – recently clarified in writing that it did not recommend abolition of SSC to any state. “Rather than looking for reasons to not give SCS, it is very important in democracy to honour the assurance given to the state on the floor of the House,” he wrote. Ever since Telangana, along with Hyderabad, was carved out of Andhra Pradesh, the state debt burden has reached a whooping sum of Rs 2.20 lakh crore. Jagan pointed that since Independence the state had accrued a debt of Rs 97,000 crore.  However, it shot up by an additional Rs 1.20 lakh crore since bifurcation which has put the state at a serious disadvantage. “With this level of debt and lack of industries, how can we survive without CCS,” he said.  According to Jaganmohan, since his party with six MPs has been unable to achieve SCS, they introduced a first ever no confidence motion against the central government. “In this backdrop, I request you to extend support for the cause and join us in chorus when we move the No Confidence motion on 21 March in the ongoing budget session,” he said while adding that if the government still doesn't pay heed to their demands, all YSRCP MPs would resign on 6 April.  Political parties in Andhra Pradesh have raised a banner of revolt against the central government over the SCS. In fact, last week, two TDP ministers even resigned from the central government in protest while their leader Chandrababu Naidu has been making stinging attacks on the government, particularly the Prime Minister, over SCS.  On 15 March, he even accused Modi of deploying the same tactics in Andhra as he did in Tamil Nadu where he pitted the OPS faction of   against the EPS faction, which eventually led to a split. He claimed that the prime minister was using YSRCP and Jana Sena's Pawan Kalyan against him in the state. He also claimed that a strong anti-BJP and anti-Modi feeling is gaining ground in the country which according to him also reflected in the by-poll results announced earlier.  Meanwhile, actor turned politician Kalyan too has backed Jaganmohan over his decision of a no-confidence motion against the government. Although, the no confidence motion in no way threatens the incumbent government, it is being seen as a way to send a message to voters in Andhra. Despite BJP's loss of three seats in UP and Bihar by-polls, the saffron party still has a comfortable majority with 272 members in the Lok Sabha since the majority mark has fallen to 269 due to vacancies created after death of two BJP MPs from Kairana and Palghar.

There is also the issue of alleged transfer of fire arms from Sikkim to Bengal a few weeks ago. Besides, former India footballer and Baichung Bhutia was being wooed by Chamling's Sikkim Democratic Front as well as Sikkim Krantikari Morcha after he resigned from Banerjee's Trinamool Congress. Relations between the states soured last year after Chamling expressed displeasure and concern at the way Bengal was handling the Gorkhaland agitation. In the absence of an airport, the only way to approach hilly landlocked Sikkim from within India is through Bengal. “Banerjee wanted to maintain good relations with other states so that industrialists do not face problems in setting up units in Darjeeling,” a senior Trinamool leader said.",2018-03-14 19:02:00+05:30,, Mamata to meet Pawan Chamling | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
433,Aditya Menon,"The BJP has taken over the entire Congress vote in Tripura. The Congress' vote share in the state has consistently been above 40% as it was the main Opposition party in the state. It has fallen to less than 2%. The entire vote has gone to the BJP. However, it does seem that a substantial chunk of Congress' Muslim voters moved to the Left Front and not the BJP. The Left Front managed a significant vote share of 45%, a fall of 7% from 2013. It is clear, therefore, that the BJP largely gained at the Congress' expense, with only a small chunk of disgruntled Left voters flocking to it. The Congress appears to have paid the price for its alliance with the Left in 2016 in West Bengal. This decision triggered an exodus of party workers and leaders, who no longer trusted the party to take on the Left in Tripura. The BJP's dominance was most apparent in urban areas. It has won all the seats in Agartala. It's state unit chief Biplab Kumar Deb won from Banamalipur in the heart of the city and he's likely to be the new chief minister of the state. It also emerged victorious in other seats in the state capital such as Bordowali, Agartala, Ramnagar, Badharghat, Barjala, Suryamaninagar and Pratapgarh It also won in other urban centres like Dharmanagar, Mohanpur and Bishalgarh. Curiously, it lost in Kailashahar to CPI(M)'s Mobashir Ali mainly because Congress candidate Birajit Sinha managed to get 7700 votes. Unemployment among the youth was a major issue in urban areas and BJP appears to have done phenomenally well among young voters. BJP's alliance with the IPFT appears to have worked wonders in the areas dominated by Tripura's indigenous people. The alliance won alliance has won 16 out of 20 seats reserved for Scheduled Tribes. CPI(M) won three. In one seat, counting is yet to take place. This is CPI(M)'s worst ever performance in Tribal areas. Even when it lost in 1972 and 1988, it had won 10 ST seats. The BJP-IPFT alliance managed to capture the resentment of the indigenous people, particularly the youth, against the Left. There was also a complete shift of tribal votes from the INPT to the IPFT. Last time, the INPT got 7.5% votes in the state overall and 41% in the seats it contested. This time it was reduced to just 0.7% vote share in the state. Where the Left managed to do comparatively better are rural seats dominated by Bengali speaking farmers. The Left managed to win close to half these seats, indicating that it's base in these areas is intact. It also managed to win the three seats where Muslims form a significant part of the electorate: Boxanagar, Kadamtala Kurti and Kaliashahar. The BJP's win in Tripura might seem inconsequential from the perspective of the 2019 elections as the state just has two Lok Sabha seats, it is perhaps the BJP's most significant win under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president  . Till now under Modi, the BJP has done well in two kinds of states: First, where it's main rival is the Congress - Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Goa, Gujarat and Manipur. Even in Jammu and Kashmir, BJP did well only in the Hindu-dominated Jammu region where it was up against the Congress. Second, states like Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, where Congress was one of its rivals but the BJP benefitted from the fact that it always had a base in the state. In contrast to these were states like Delhi, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where the party lost to powerful regional parties/alliances. Tripura is the first state in which the BJP has managed to defeat a powerful, cadre-based regional formation like the Left Front, that too in a state where it had little presence until three years ago. This is an important lesson for several regional leaders like Naveen Patnaik, K Chandrasekhar Rao, Mamata Banerjee and Pinarayi Vijayan. Interestingly, this is also one of the few states where the party won without making any appeals to Hindutva.  Amit Shah made his intentions clear during his post-victory press conference on Saturday when he said, ""Our golden era will begin when we win Odisha, West Bengal and Kerala as well"".",2018-03-03 21:06:00+05:30,, Tripura elections 2018: Three factors that led to BJP's victory in Tripura | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

437,Catch Team,"The   that created history in Tripura has also notched up its best performance in Nagaland by winning 12 seats. With the state witnessing a hung Assembly, the BJP has emerged as the kingmaker being wooed by both the main regional parties.  They are sure to be in the next government with either the Shurhozelie Liezietsu and TR Zeilang-led Naga People’s Front or the Neiphiu Rio-led Nationalist Democratic People’s Party (NDPP) with which it had a pre-poll alliance. The previous best for the BJP was seven seats under the leadership of senior leader Hokishe Sema in 2003 when Atal Behari Vajpayee was Prime Minister. In 2013, the saffron party was reduced to just one seat. “In Nagaland, NDPP-BJP alliance has secured 30 seats. With the support of 1 independent we are comfortably placed to form d government,” tweeted Ram Madhav. The figures at 6.30 pm indicated that the NPF had won 27 seats and its allies – Conrad Sangma’s National People’s Party and   (United) had won one each. The BJP’s 12 with NDPP’s 17 also makes up 29, indicating a tie in the state. An independent who won, Tongpang Ozukum from the Angetyongpang constituency, is believed to be with NPF, but could switch sides, say sources. Later in the evening the JD(U) announced its support for the BJP for “the formation of a stable government in Nagaland”, indicating that it could shift to the NDPP in case the BJP chooses to stick with Rio. However, BJP’s party in-charge for Nagaland, Kiren Rijiju, was cautious. “It is a hung Assembly, so we will have to discuss,” party in-charge for Nagaland Rijiju told Catch. “ The NPF seemed confident of getting the BJP on its side. “The BJP may go with us for sake of stability. There will be a meeting of the party president and CM candidate Mr TR Zeliang with Mr Rijiju tomorrow,” said a senior NPF source. The trouble is that if the BJP enters the NPF coalition, smaller partners could raise objections during portfolio sharing. Only 12 portfolios can be distributed and due to a recent Supreme Court ruling, the liberal and indiscriminate appointment of parliamentary secretaries by any chief minister may not be possible. Indications are that the saffron party, which contested on 20 seats in a pre-poll alliance with NDPP, could finally bring three-time chief minister Rio back into state politics. Rio’s hopes of being chief minister seemed dashed till afternoon but results in small constituencies changed rapidly. An elated Rio told a news channel that “Prime Minister Modi is a star.” Ultimately, the rivalry between Rio and Zeliang may end in the victory for the more experienced Rio. Zeliang is also said to have been in touch with BJP leaders even ahead of elections in which his NPF and BJP fought tooth and nail. The clashes reportedly resulted in the death of a person in the Akuloto constituency in Zunheboto district on polling day. On the eve of counting day, the NPF that went ballistic against the BJP and tried to brand it an “alien” and “Hindutva party”, changed tack and tried to build bridges. The BJP had never burnt the bridges with the NPF, despite apparent bitterness. Rijiju had made it clear in Guwahati ahead of the elections that NPF is “not an enemy”. In a release Friday, NPF announced that in the interest of the political solution to the Naga problem it continues to be an alliance partner of the BJP. One of the first priorities of a BJP-supported government here will be to bring in a settlement to the talks with the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) and other groups. The proscribed NSCN (Khaplang) also did not engage in mischief during the polls and is believed to be in backdoor talks to come to the negotiating table. In the final year before the General Elections, Prime Minister   may spring a surprise by wrapping up the Naga problem. NSCN (IM) sources said they are extremely hopeful. “We even welcome the NSCN (K) to join the talks, there can be only a single solution,” said the source. Incidentally, the NSCN (IM) has consistently favoured Rio as the chief minister and the true facilitator of the talks. As for the BJP, the Naga solution could be showcased to the electorate as efforts by the NDA government to bring peace in the region.",2018-03-04 04:03:00+05:30,," Nagaland polls: BJP wins 12 seats, emerges as kingmaker in hung house  | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

""It has been an honor to serve my country and enact pro-growth economic policies to benefit the American people, in particular, the passage of historic tax reform. I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future,"" the 57-year-old Cohn said in a statement, media reported. Also Read:  His resignation reportedly will take effect in the coming weeks. ""Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,"" said Trump in a statement released by the White House. ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people,"" the president added. Cohn is the latest in a long list of Trump's close advisers to resign and the announcement comes just a few days after the departure of the president's faithful adviser and communications director, Hope Hicks. Also Read:  Although the White House has not yet confirmed that Cohn has ended his term with the administration due to his differences with Trump on the tariff issue, it is public knowledge that the former Goldman Sachs president and COO had opposed the mogul's plan to raise tariffs on imported steel by 25 percent and on aluminum by 10 percent. The president announced last week that he would impose the tariffs despite the opposition of a large number of Republican lawmakers and Cohn. Also Read:  The departure of Cohn, a Democrat who is a defender of free trade, could have a domino effect on the president's economic decisions and on the financial sector, given that last August, the mere threat of his exit caused the investment markets to tumble.

The drubbing in the state polls barely three months ago has had no sobering effect on the party's factionalism. Cadres feel it is high time the leaders pull up their socks and start gearing up for the forthcoming parliamentary polls. But former chief minister Virbhadra Singh and HP Congress Committee chief Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu continue to run each other down and exchange barbs on every possible occasion.  In a bid to get its act together, the party recently organised a state-level conference in Mandi and launched a campaign seeking accountability from sitting Lok Sabha members of the   (BJP). The venue was significant as the party had scored a big zero in the district, which was once its stronghold and sends 10 legislators to the Assembly. But this effort was marred by the absence of Virbhadra and most of his supporters and his son Vikramaditya Singh.  The Congress Legislative Party's (CLP) Mukesh Agnihotri and the All-India Congress Committee (AICC) in-charge for the state Ranjeet Ranjan though attended. Sukhu claimed Virbhadra was invoted. The Mandi chapter followed an exchange of barbs between Sukhu and Virbhadra barely 10 days ago. The former royal has been consistently demanding that Sukhu be replaced, claiming the party wouldn't win the parliamentary polls under his leadership.  Sukhu, on his part, had called Virbhadra a liar and pointed out that the suffered a terrible defeat in the recent assembly poll under Virbhadra. According to him, 56 of the 68 tickets for the 2017 Assembly polls were given on Virbhadra's recommendations. Only 15 of those candidates sailed through; on the other hand, six of the 12 candidates approved by the party organisation won.  Virbhadra's detractors have been blaming his ego for the departure of senior Congress leaders like Anil Sharma and Vijay Singh Mankotia. They don't fail to point out that the former CM decided all candidates for the 2014 parliamentary polls and the party couldn't win a single seat in the state. “Both these leaders have own goals to achieve. It is a fact that the Virbhadra era is over and he is on the verge of retirement but he wants to capture the ground for his son. His entire effort is that his son either becomes the state unit chief or an AICC general secretary at the earliest. But everyone knows the culture of the Congress where things move by just an inch after long intervals,” said a party insider. He further disclosed that Sukhu, on the other hand, is keen to prolong his stint. “If he manages to remain the PCC chief till the forthcoming parliamentary polls, it would be a big achievement for him,” he added. Some sources said Sukhu's tenure has been marked by the party organisation being strengthened at the grassroots and Virbhadra's sheer desperation has brought the party to this point. According to them, Vikramaditya has had no major achievement and several Congress workers are annoyed at the dynastic trend. As of now, the field lies wide open for a strong leadership to emerge in the state. Mukesh Agnihotri, a four-time election winner, was one evident choice as CLP leader. Party heavyweight Asha Kumari would have been an obvious choice but for the episode of her slapping a policewoman.  As the party brass grapples with preparing for elections in Karnataka, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and the Lok Sabha, no one seems to be bothered about what is happening in the Himalayan state.

After this remarkable victory, PM, Modi in a weekly Parliamentary Party meeting said that ""The victory in Tripura is historic and we should not undermine it just because our opponents are saying it is a small state in a distant part of the country.” However, the happiness could not last long as there came reports of sporadic violence and clashes in Tripura and the demolition of a statue of communist icon Vladimir Lenin and hence section 144 was imposed in several places.After two Lenin’s statues were demolished, a statue of EV Ramasamy, commonly known as Periyar (anti-untouchability) activist and Dravidian movement leader, was vandalised by two men in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district on Tuesday evening.  As per the police, the nose of the Periyar statue inside Tirupathur Corporation Office was damaged by the vandals. Violence isn't limited to Tripura alone, it has spread to other states like Kolkata, Coimbatore and other parts of Tamil Nadu.  On Wednesday another case of vandalism was recorded in Jadavpur University Kolkata.

455,Charu Kartikeya,"There is little doubt that the Telugu Desam Party's decision to withdraw its ministers from the  -led government at the Centre will have serious implications for the   (BJP).  It must be noted though that TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu is still keeping windows open. He has not exited the National Democratic Alliance; even while announcing the resignations, he maintained a level of cordiality. That is in contrast to the sharp attacks that marked recent outburts by   leaders against the BJP. Even as two BJP ministers resigned from Naidu's Andhra Pradesh government in a tit-for-tat move, the chief minister appreciated their work and thanked them.Naidu's considered avoidance of an aggressive break-up appears understandable. He can hope to influence the Union government only as long as he is within the ruling alliance. Once outside the NDA, he will lose all options to negotiate. What is not entirely clear, however, is the BJP's approach. Finance Minister  's statements, which Naidu indicated precipitated the crisis, were hardly short of a snub. They amounted to not just a firm rejection of the demand for special status, but also a dig at TDP for demanding too much. Naidu has been saying for a long time now that he visited Delhi 29 times in the recent past, but no one in the BJP paid any heed to him. He has also alleged that Prime Minister Modi was “unavailable” when he tried to inform the latter over the phone about TDP's decision to exit the government. Why the BJP's attitude is baffling because the TDP is among its biggest allies in Delhi, with 16 members in the Lok Sabha. Only Shiv Sena has more (18) than that and the it has openly rebelled. The Telangana Rashtra Samithi, once sympathetic to the BJP – though formally not a part of the NDA – has also declared lack of confidence in the party's government and has called for a non-BJP, non-Congress alliance. The Yuvajana Shramika Rythu Congress Party is the only party that the BJP can still force to dance to its tunes because of the plethora of cases against its chief Jaganmohan Reddy. However, it has all of nine members in the lower house, far short of TDP's tally. Also, there is no guarantee of the YSRCP's support because special status for Andhra is an emotive issue that it can not avoid. Could it be that recent electoral victories in Tripura, Meghalaya and Nagaland have made the BJP complacent about returning to power in the Lok Sabha with bigger numbers of its own? If that is indeed the case, then the NDA appears all set to run into rough weather, because Lok Sabha polls are still at some distance.",2018-03-08 18:20:00+05:30,, Is NDA all set to run into rough weather? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

Mamata Banerjee, the party chief would take a final decision about Bachchan being a frontrunner for the nomination, a senior Trinamool Congress leader confirmed. The leader also said, “The official announcement is likely to be made around March 18.""Fifty-eight MPs will retire from Rajya Sabha in April. Ten seats will fall vacant from Uttar Pradesh, which is expected to bring the BJP — which won 312 of the 403 Assembly seats last year — major gains. The SP, which Bachchan now represents, has the numbers to win only one seat. The Trinamool leader said, “Four of our MP seats are to be vacated, and a number of people are lobbying. At least two new nominees will be seen in the Upper House,” said another source in the Trinamool. Bachchan had begun “sending feelers” to Mamata soon after the UP Assembly election results. “Jaya Bachchan’s Bengali roots and her continued popularity in the state makes her an ideal candidate.

462,Mohit   Mohanan,"The Black law ordinance (Criminal Laws Amendment Bill) which protects officers, politicians and the judges from being investigated has been finally withdrawn. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje today announced the withdrawal of this controversial Bill which was able to protect serving and former judges, magistrates and public servants from being investigated for on-duty action without government sanction which also able to bar the media from reporting on accusations of such wrongdoings till the government sanctions a probe.The draconian provisions of this bill not only protects the corrupt public servants but also challenges the freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed under article 19 1 (a) of Indian constitution barring the press to report the cases against public servants. The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2017 was tabled in the Assembly last year by state Home minister Gulab Chand Kataria, and had invited sharp criticism and protest from the opposition, rights groups and others. ""We referred the Bill to the Select Committee, we allowed the ordinance to get lapsed and when it is not a law yet, then what should we withdraw? However, we are taking the Bill back from the Select Committee,"" Raje said in the House amid an uproar by members of the opposition.   On September 2017, the Rajasthan government brought The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2017 with an intention to muzzle the press. It was an act of legislative conspiracy that came in action overnight. Also, the media did not have an iota of the Bill.  The Rajasthan Patrika was the first Newspaper who broke the story about it. An article against this Bill, written by the Editor in chief of Patrika newspaper group Gulab Kothari was published on the front page of the edition that came out on October 22, 2017. The newspaper ran a campaign called ""Jab Tak Kala, Tab Tak Tala"" came into action on the newspaper on November 1, 2017. The following days, it started carrying a Black Lock Box on front page symbolic to countdown and reminding the government each day of the resolve for taking back the Black Bill without any compromise. On the occasion of National Press Day (November 16, 2017), the newspaper stressed on the issue by leaving the edit column blank with a Black Boundary to signify the state of affairs and the position on the draconian bill which will jeopardize the interests of the state and its public at large by muzzling the free voice forever. The struggle was in larger interest and hence, the national media has come heavily in our support. Rajasthan Patrika pledged its fight till the rollback of this ordinance. We are publishing a book on this whole saga of the black ordinance. The book is divided into various chapters about the Black ordinance, the protest, proceedings in the courts, cartoons etc. We have amalgamated articles by various personalities too.  On Legislative par, the Black ordinance got lapse on December 4, 2017. But was still in consideration with the select committee of the state legislature.

497,Sadiq Naqvi  ,"The   (BJP) will not have to face a united Opposition in the important forthcoming by-elections in Goraphpur and Phoolpur Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, sources said. The seats fell vacant as their representatives Chief Minister Adityanath (from Gorakhpur) and his deputy Keshav Maurya (Phoolpur) had to give them up to join the state legislature. The BJP swept last year's UP Assembly polls while others, notably the Congress, the   (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party, faced a serious drubbing. For the bypolls though the saffron party is yet to announce its candidates. The SP is likely to field Santosh Nishad from Gorakhpur. His father Sanjay Nishad heads the Nishad Party, which has a sizeable following among the Nishad community whose members have tradionally been boatsmen. Gorakhpur is said to have a sizeable number of Nishads.  But that's not the only reason behind chosing Santosh. According to a source close to SP chief  , the party is trying to build the foundation for the Lok Sabha polls.  “Getting an important Nishad leader on board will help in 2019,” an SP leader said.  Fielding Santosh from Gorakhpur can also ensure the support of other smaller outfits like the Peace Party, which has a following among the backward class Pasmanda Muslims. This could pose a challenge for the BJP and Adityanath. The five-time parliamentarian from Gorakhpur also heads the important Gorakhnath Math there. In Phoolpur, meanwhile, caste equations may tilt the balance. From this seat once represented by Jawaharlal Nehru, the SP is likely to field Nagendra Patel, a local party leader. The constituency has a sizeable population of Kurmis, to which Patel belongs. There were talks of Krishna Patel, the wife of Sonelal Patel and estranged mother of Union Minister Anupriya Patel, contesting as the Opposition candidate. But she wasn't ready to contest on the SP symbol, according to an SP leader.  “We could not afford to not have a candidate contest on our symbol in the bypolls,” the leader said. He also highlighted how talks were initiated about two months ago, but they fell through after reservations on contesting on the party symbol.  “We can give them one or two seats in the 2019 elections. But ceding space in the bypolls is out of question,” the leader said. “Not contesting the by-polls on its own symbol will hurt the morale of the party workers,” he added. Senior SP leader and state unit chief Naresh Uttam Patel’s name also did the rounds, but the party is likely to chose a local. Naresh Uttam comes from neighbouring Fatehpur. The SP hopes to capitalise on the Kurmi votebank by fielding a Patel and is banking on the fact that other communities that voted it in the past would not desert it.  “We are also hopeful that since Indrajeet Saroj joined the party after leaving the  , we should be able to get some Dalit votes as well. And together with the Kurmi, other backward and the minority votebank, we should be comfortable,” an SP leader said. Saroj, who left the BSP last August, is said to have a following among the Pasi community. The BSP, as has been its history, is yet again not contesting the by-polls. Meanwhile, the SP leader said the party has a strong presence in at least five of the six Assembly segments that make up the Phoolpur Lok Sabha constituency. “We are not that strong in Allahabad North,” an SP leader said. The SP won Phulpur from 1996 to 2004, but lost in 2009 and 2014. Maurya won the last election by a large margin. Late Friday evening the Congress announced the candidature of Surheeta Chatterjee Karim from Gorakhpur and Manish Mishra from Phoolpur. Karim is a local doctor while Mishra is a general secretary in party's state unit. He is the son of JS Mishra, who served as the personal secretary to former prime minister Indira Gandhi.",2018-02-17 19:07:00+05:30,, BJP to face divided Opposition in bypolls from Yogi and Maurya's seat | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
498,Rajeev Khanna,"The 'hunkar' (thunder) was definitely missing from the  's (BJP) Yuva Hunkar Rally in Jind Thursday despite an address by party chief  . The response that it got from the masses as well as the Opposition is an indication that the BJP is definitely on the defensive in the state as far as the forthcoming Lok Sabha and subsequent Assembly polls are concerned.  This is also evident from the fact that with not much to write home about the performance of the Manohar Lal Khattar government in the state, the party's much-touted poll campaign by Shah began on a negative note. Most of the time was spent blaming the Congress instead of recounting the BJP's achievements. In the process the BJP sent out negative signals with commoners pointing out that such events are normally planned by the Opposition; the ruling party should foclus on addressing the concerns of the people than such antics where the chief minister and the party president are promoted riding motorcycles. Shah harped on the BJP's promise of a corruption-free, inclusive government. But the people were more keen to hear what the party had to say on the conduct of the central government over the flight of scam accused likes of Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallaya. By Thursday evening videos of empty chairs at the rally went viral; anyway, allegations regarding the mining scam in Dadam area of Bhiwani and other areas that have hit headlines at regular intervals. Shah chose to focus his attack on the Congress, particularly on the former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. The BJP chief said during his regime central funds for Haryana “used to go down the gutter of corruption”. “Listen Hooda ji, I have come here with all accounts to be put before the people,” he said as he tried to compare the corruption during the Congress regime with the “development and corruption-free government” under his party's regime. The BJP has been claiming that the rally would create a world record but the empty chairs at the venue proved to be a counter to the claims. “There is not a single allegation of corruption against the Khattar government. This is a big achievement,” he said, claiming Khattar initiated a number of pro-people measures. He also claimed that during this regime the state has been free of nepotism, corruption and regionalism. He then focused on what the central government's recent budget has to offer to the masses. Both the Congress and Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) have termed the BJP rally a failure. Hooda has asked the BJP to spell the motive behind the rally while the state Congress unit chief Ashok Tanwar alleged that Rs 100 crore was spent on this rally in terms of making security and arrangements. Tanwar was arrested along with his supporters when he had gone to oppose Shah's rally. The Indian National Lokdal (INLD) workers too had protested at various places by showing black flags. The party had opposed the event on the grounds that the BJP government in the state as well as at the Centre has been doing nothing to get Haryana its water dues by expediting the construction of the Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal. INLD leaders have also been vocal about their resentment against the BJP's tourism minister in Goa having made adverse comments against Haryanavis. The BJP cannot expect to find buyers to its tall claims given the experience of Khattar administration having unraveled repeatedly, particularly on the law and order front. In the last three years of its existence the government has stood exposed for its inability to check mayhem in the instances of the law catching up with controversial godmen Ram Pal and Ram Rahim.  The state is still to recover from the damage that the mishandling of the Jat reservation agitation did to the social fabric as the community stood isolated from the remaining 35 Biradaris (communities) of the state. The government's record in checking the violence against women has been among the worst in the country with the state recording most heinous rapes at regular intervals and the Punjab and Haryana High Court continuing to shame the state for its inability to bring to book the culprits of the Murthal mass rapes during height of the Jat agitation of 2016.  Then there has also been the menace of cow vigilantes that has alienated the minorities and the Dalits. The Dalits have otherwise also been targeted in the state and have been very vulnerable to the assaults by upper castes. These are subjects which Shah and his leaders would not touch but the people would remember when the time comes for polling.  The BJP's electoral graph at this point of time is looking to dip in Haryana in a big way unless the party comes up with something that can check this slide.",2018-02-16 22:28:00+05:30,, Amit Shah's flop rally shows BJP desperately needs to check slide in Haryana | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

He has said he intends to regain the trust of South Africans whose faith in politics was shaken during Zuma's term. During the last municipal elections in 2016, the ANC suffered a shocking loss in some of its former strongholds, which some analysts said could portend an impending loss in a national election, unimaginable only a decade earlier. In a statement after his inauguration, the ANC began encouraging Ramaphosa to begin implementing economic reforms - including a controversial policy of forcibly redistributing land, which economists have said could backfire. ""The African National Congress has full confidence in President Ramaphosa to build on the foundation laid and focus the country on accelerating our program of fundamental and radical socio-economic transformation,"" the statement said. ""This will include giving effect to the ANC resolutions to accelerate land redistribution through among other mechanisms, the expropriation of land without compensation."" For many, Zuma's resignation was a much-needed affirmation that after a bruising few years, South Africa's young democracy was still intact.

518,Speed News Desk,"Two days after by-polls in Rajasthan were held on two Lok Sabha seats and one assembly seat, intense discussions between the party-men are taking place predicting the results of the elections. Workers and leaders from both sides seem to reach to an idea on the outcome of Alwar parliamentary seat, while they find difficult to forecast the fate of Ajmer Lok Sabha and Mandalgarh assembly segment. The counting of votes on the three seats will be held tomorrow. (February 1)Even as the ruling BJP has been battling anti-incumbency factor on all three seats, it is yet to be seen if the resentment of Rajputs, who openly announced to vote against BJP, would actually result into votes in favour of Congress. Rajputs have been staunch supporters of BJP since its infant days as for Jan Sangh. Particularly, Former Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat was the one, who bought majority of Rajputs to get associated with the saffron party.   Nearly two weeks ago, when more than a dozen Rajput, Ravana Rajput, and Charan Rajput organizations held a press conference in Jaipur to declare opposition against BJP, their leaders accused the ruling party of “ignoring” Rajput leaders like Shekhawat and former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh. Political pundits believe that Rajput outfits are in a position to the influence the outcome of Ajmer Lok Sabha seat.  Moreover, low voter turnout in Ajmer city‘s both assembly segments (Ajmer North 55.88%, Ajmer South 59.46%) is being seen as a result of inactiveness of BJP workers as well RSS cadres in the area. Party insiders blamed it on BJP‘s choice of candidate, Ramswaroop Lamba, who despite being a political greenhorn was chosen to encash Jat community‘s sympathy for his father ex-minister Sanwar Lal Jat, whose death necessitated the by-poll. In Alwar Lok Sabha area, the voters‘ resentment against local leadership was being seen a major factor against the ruling party. The Yadav community, which is said to be game-changer in the parliamentary seat, appears to have sympathized with Congress candidate Karan Singh who has made a comeback to politics after a decade. Meanwhile, Mandalgarh assembly seat will see a very tough contest as the voting percentage was also high in the constituency. The Congress and BJP are going neck-to-neck in the contest. ",2018-01-31 17:51:00+05:30,, Rajasthan By-polls: Daunting task for BJP to retain it's seats | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

Working President of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, Dinesh Gundu Rao, also indicated that party MLAs facing anti-incumbency in their constituencies, may not get tickets in polls, due in May. He added that joining hands with the JD(S) in case Congress fails to get a majority is not being looked at as an option as his party is confident of coming to power on its own, and also that the H D Deve Gowda-led outfit is ""not dependable"". Speaking to PTI here, Gundu Rao said Gandhi is going to be a ""very key"" campaigner for the Congress in the state where he noted, it also has ""very powerful"" state leaders like Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, M Mallikarjuna Kharge, G Parameshwara and D K Shivakumar. ""At the same time, I think Rahulji is getting resonance amongst people, and he is leading the campaign for us,"" Gundu Rao, who was here to attend an event, said. The Congress president is starting his campaign with a three-day tour of the state from February 10. He might visit again later next month and also in March. ""In the run-up to the elections, he will be spending lot more time, and he is definitely going to lead from the front for us"", he said.

""Gandhi would be intensively campaigning and you can say more or less launch of the campaign for the Congress (with his February tour),"" the Congress leader added. He claimed there is no anti-incumbency on the government because out of 165 promises made in the election manifesto, it has implemented 155-156. In fact, Gundu Rao said the Congress is seeing pro-incumbency wave creeping in, adding, it would win a number of seats than the last time. Gundu Rao, however, said that some Congress MLAs might have ""built-up"" anti-incumbency in their constituencies. ""That's what we need to look out for. If they have not done well, we have to change then, that's going to be the key thing,"" he said. Congress MLAs facing anti-incumbency will be ""definitely changed"", as the party's aim is to field ""best available candidates"", he said. On whether the Congress would look for an understanding with JD(S) in case it falls short on numbers in the post-poll scenario, he said, ""There is no question of us wanting an alliance because we are clearly in the race to get an absolute majority."" ""But post-poll...what happens...who knows? I can't predict right now. JD(S) is not dependable. They have been with BJP, they have formed a government with us, they are not people who can be trusted because they don't have an ideology, don't have fixed agenda, they can play anything; they are not dependable at all.

544,Nishant  Chhabra,"Considered as the semifinals for the Assembly polls scheduled later this year in Rajasthan, the crucial by-polls for the two Lok Sabha constituencies and one Assembly seat are all set to be fought on the caste lines rather than on issues or the personal merits of the candidates. The polls have become an issue of prestige between the BJP Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and the Congress leaders, the former Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot and the Pradesh Congress Committee president, Sachin Pilot. While all three seats were won by the BJP in the previous elections, retaining them appears to be an uphill task for the saffron party owing to a number of factors. Sachin Pilot is trying hard to prove his mettle in the state by winning the by-elections but his difficulties arise from the in-fighting among the top brass in the Congress in the state.  For the BJP also, a number of national and state-level developments are posing a serious challenge. They include issues like demonetisation and GST brought about by the NDA Government at the Centre and the killing of the gangster Anandpal last year in a police encounter. The pending issue of farm loan waiver is also an irritant for the ruling party.  Keeping in mind the challenges, Chief Minister  Raje herself is campaigning in the constituencies. Same is the case with Pilot, who is hitting the roads to boost his party’s prospects. However, apart from the personality factors and the political and economic issue one aspect that stands out in all the three  constituencies is the caste factor. This is more so as the candidates have been fielded by both the parties after taking into consideration their respective castes. For Ajmer, BJP has fielded former MP Sanwar Lal Jat’s son Ramswaroop Lamba. The Jats are the second largest community here after the Schedule Caste voters. The seat has more than three lakh SC voters followed 2.5 lakh Jats. The Muslims, Rajputs and Gurjars individually constitute 2 lakh voters each. Others include more than 1.5 lakh Brahmins, Banias and Rawats and Mali voters. The Congress choice in Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, is a senior leader in the State. He has served as the chief whip of the party in the state in the past. In Alwar, the Congress has fielded Karan Singh Yadav while the BJP has gone for  Jaswant Singh Yadav. Both the parties have targeted the dominant Yadav vote bank. There is more than two lakh Yadav voters in the constituency bordering Haryana. Alwar has an equal number of Brahmins, Meo Muslims and Scheduled Castes (SCs). The electorate here also include more than a lakh Meenas, 80,000 Malis and 50,000 Rajputs. In Mandalgarh, Dhakkads, a farming community,  numbering about 40,000, form the majority of the voters. Besides them, there are more than 30,000, SC/STs,  25,000 Brahmins, and around 10,000 Rajputs. Targeting the dominant Dhakads the Congress has fielded Vivek Dhakad,  a local leader while the BJP has given the ticket to  Shakti Singh Hada, a senior BJP leader in Bhilwara district.",2018-01-20 20:09:00+05:30,, Caste is the Credo in Rajasthan By-polls | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

555,Sebastian Sunny,"It is going to be a no-holds barred battle in Rajasthan! That the ruling BJP would be leaving no stone unturned for the ensuing battle at the husting in Rajasthan by-elections this month-end is now clear from the list of the star campaigners it has announced. Not to be surprised! The names which top the list--which  includes Union Ministers as well that of the State-- are of Prime Minister Narenda Modi, BJP national President   and Union Home Minister  .The long list of the star campaigners for by-elections to the Lok Sabha constituencies of Ajmer and Alwar and the Assembly seat of Mandalgarh, released by the BJP state headquarters on Thursday, has been cleared by none other than Amit Shah. The 40-strong list includes six union ministers, other than Rajnath Singh,  ,  , C.R.Chowdhury, P.P.Choudhary, Arjunlal Meghwal and Gajendra Singh Shekhawat. Of course, Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje is on the top of the heap leading the assorted group of home-grown leaders including 12 Ministers from Rajasthan, starting with the senior most, Home Minister Gulabchand Kataria and followed by Rajendra Singh Rathore, Arun Chaturvedi, Hemsingh Bhadana-- to suit all the important caste denominations in the constituencies of Ajmer and Alwar. Among the campaigners include Raje’s son and MP from Jhalawar, Dushyant Singh, his wife, Niharika Raje, party functionaries including the Rajasthan BJP president Ashok Parnami.  The BJP has fielded Ramswarup Lamba, the son of the   Sanwarlal Jat, for Ajmer. Its nominee for Alwar is Jaswant Yadav, a former MP and presently a Minister in the State Cabinet.  Both Jaswant Yadav and his Congress rival Karan Singh Yadav have represented Alwar seat in the past.  The Ajmer Lok Sabha seat is prestigious for both the Congress and the BJP as the seat was contested between  Pradesh Congress President Sachin Pilot and  Sanwarlal Jat, who was the chairman of the State Kisan Ayog at the time of his demise in August last year. Jat had won the seat in 2014 with a margin of 1.77 lakh votes. Though the Congress party has fielded a former MLA Raghu Sharma from the seat, the outcome is equally important for Pilot as the onus for a victory from the seat, represented by him in the past, is on him. Mandalgarh Assembly seat in Bhilwara district, which fell vacant after the death of BJP MLA,   Kumari, too is no less prestigious as it falls within the former Lok Sabha seat of senior Congress leader C.P. Joshi. The Congress has fielded Vivek Dhakkad from the seat while the BJP nominee is Shakti Singh Hada. “In a way this is conceding defeat on the part of the BJP,” argued Mahesh Joshi, former Congress MP  talking to Catch News. “Never before in the State’s electoral history in my memory a Prime Minister has participated in a by-election,” he pointed out. The BJP leaders acted shy of commenting on the star campaigners’ lineup. “We are winning the by-elections,” said Om Birla, BJP MP from Kota. He also pointed out that just because the names were there on the list it was not necessary that the Prime Minister took part in the campaign. The impressive lineup of the star campaigners is surely an indication of the importance the BJP gives to the by-elections in Rajasthan. It perhaps also betrays the unease in the party over the possible outcome of the by-polls as any adverse result would surely have an impact on the general mood in the state which will have its elections to the State Assembly in November-December.",2018-01-11 21:16:00+05:30,," A heavy star cast for Rajasthan by-poll: PM Modi, BJP president Amit Shah to campaign | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/
556,Nishant  Chhabra,"In a turn of events for Bollywood film 'Padmavati' (now Padmavat), the Rajasthan High Court on Friday ordered film director   to show the movie in the court before January 23.The court gave these directions while hearing a petition filed by  Bhansali requesting to quash an FIR registered against him and others, actor   and actress    with Deedwana police station in Nagaur district of Rajasthan. The movie is slated for release on January 25. Bhansali had filed a revision petition in the Rajasthan High Court at Jodhpur, requesting the FIR registered against him to be quashed. The FIR was lodged with Deedwana police station on February 17, 2017 under Sections 153A and 295A of IPC. In the FIR, complainant Virendra Singh and Nagpal Singh have alleged that the movie threatened to disrupt communal harmony and would hurt the religious sentiments of a community. In the review petition, it was pleaded that the movie had not even been released, so the complainants didn’t have any basis to determine if the claims made in the FIR were true. The single bench of Justice Sandeep Mehta stated that the FIR raised serious allegations against the petitioners and it could not be quashed without judging the merit of the complaint. The court has asked the producers to hold a film screening in the court before January 23. The lawyers told the court that they would consult with their client, Sanjay Leela Bhansali and appraise the court of the date when the screening could be held. The High Court had earlier ordered a stay on the FIR, directing the police not to take any further action in the matter. The court had also sought an explanation from the complainants. Notably, the Censor Board recently allowed the producers to release the movie after carrying out some changes. The movie’s name was also changed to Padmavat from Padmavati. However there exists a ban on the film in Rajasthan. The State Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said that the Home Minister Gulab Chand Kataria has been directed to take steps to prevent the release of the Ranveer Singh– Deepika Padukone –   starer. Besides Rajasthan, the governments of Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat have also said no to the screening of the film in their respective territories.

563,Nishant  Chhabra,"Prime Minister   on Tuesday said the Congress Party and drought are 'twin brothers' as wherever the party goes, there is drought. Speaking at a function organised to mark the commencement of  work on the Rs 43,129 crore Barmer oil refinery project in Barmer's Pachpadra, Modi said drought and Congress walk hand-in-hand and the state saw the end of drought when the party was shown the door.Touching on the slugfest between the ruling BJP and the Congress over taking credit for the refinery, located in the Thar desert, he said the Congress had only laid foundation stones for projects across the country to claim credit. Railway lines were announced just to claim short-term popularity with projects that never ever seeing the light, he charged. The Congress, he said, had ""hoodwinked"" people by making just announcements. Modi said the party, after seeing his commitment to one-rank-one-pension scheme for defence personnel, made a provision for Rs 500 crore in the interim budget just before the 2014 general elections to claim credit. ""Barmer refinery was at least on papers, OROP wasn't even on paper,"" he said, adding that no groundwork on the beneficiaries or on the outgo was ever done. It took one-and-half-years to collate the list of beneficiaries of OROP and the implementation cost Rs 12,000 crore as against Rs 500 crore provided by the Congress, he noted. Of this, four installments totaling Rs 10,700 crore have already been made to defence personnel and the rest would also be paid soon, Modi said. He said while the Congress just gave the slogan of 'garibi hatao' (remove poverty), the BJP government has worked towards doing so by way of providing free cooking gas (LPG) connection to poor women and giving free power connection to the four crore households. Ahead of the event, ruling BJP and opposition Congress bargained hard in public for claiming credit for the refinery. The Congress argument was that the then party president    had laid the foundation stone of the refinery on September 22, 2013, and the Modi act of ""re-laying"" the foundation stone was farcical. But both the Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje said that foundation laying was a political stunt carried out days before the model code of conduct for assembly elections coming into force on September 27, 2013. Neither the land was acquired for the project nor the environment clearance obtained for the foundation laying, they argued. The Tuesday's function, coming as it is  weeks before by-polls for Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha, and Mandalgarh Assembly seats in Rajasthan on January 29, had its own political overtones. The state is scheduled for  Assembly elections  later this year.  (With Agency Inputs)",2018-01-16 19:27:00+05:30,, PM Modi in Barmer; says Cong and drought are 'twin brothers' | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
564,Nishant  Chhabra,"Members of the Rajput community on Wednesday held a protest in Rajasthan's Chittorgarh against  's controversial film 'Padmaavat', demanding a complete ban on it.The Rajputs, along with those from other communities, staged a sit-in protest near Rithola crossing on the Udaipur-Ahmedabad highway blocking it for nearly half-an-hour, police said. Traffic had to be diverted due to long queues of vehicles on the busy highway, they said. No untoward incident was reported due to the precautionary measures were taken by the administration, the police said. The highway traffic returned to normality after the protesters withdrew to discuss their future course of action on the 'Padmaavat' release issue, they said. In a social media post, patron of Shree Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi gave a call for another rally, in Samrau in Jodhpur on January 21, to show solidarity to community. The film got stuck in the current controversy after various Rajput groups alleged that it distorted history, a claim repeatedly denied by Bhansali. The fact that the governments of   Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Haryana governments have banned the movie has not helped to pacify the anger of certain groups within the Rajput and the communities closely associated with it. Featuring   as Rani Padmavati,   as Maharawal Ratan Singh and   as Alauddin Khilji, the film was given a U/A certificate by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) recently after much prevarication. Last month, during the certification process of the film, Bhansali had appeared before a Parliamentary panel to state that the film was an adaptation of Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi's ""Padmavat"". The film, now slated to be released on January 25, was given a go-ahead signal by the CBFC after making the producers change the title from 'Padmavati' to 'Padmaavat' and carry out some other modifications.

566,Nishant  Chhabra,"Even before commencing operations, the Barmer refinery in Rajasthan has earned a distinction of sorts. The proposed Rs 43,129 crore project will now have two foundation stones — the first was laid by Congress leader   on September 22, 2013, and the second, slated to be laid by Prime Minister   on Tuesday, January 16. PM Modi will on Tuesday launch what is being described as ""work commencement"" for one of the country's most modern refineries in Rajasthan's Barmer district -- almost five years after Sonia Gandhi, then the Congress president had laid its foundation stone. It's is now for the second time when a big event will be held for the same project. Modi is also scheduled to address a public gathering during the programme.  The function will be held at 12:30 pm in Pachpadra town, which is about 450 km from state capital Jaipur, where the refinery is to come up. The Rs 7 billion project, when completed in the estimated time of four years, will provide direct and indirect employment to 10,000 persons.  The 9 MMTPA (million metric tonnes per annum) refinery, a joint venture between Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) and the Rajasthan government, is the state's first. Its products will conform to BS-VI emission norms. The  Barmer refinery has been the subject of a political slugfest between the Congress and Rajasthan's ruling BJP. Former Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot recently wrote to the Prime Minister questioning why the refinery's foundation stone was being laid again when this was done way back in 2013.  Soon after this, the invitation cards distributed for the event used the expression ""Work Commencement Function"" instead of the ""foundation stone laying function"". Gehlot was quick to latch onto this, describing it as a face-saving move by the  Vasundhara Raje government in the State. As per the schedule, the refinery is slated to be completed by 2022-23 and would be producing the highest grade BS-VI fuel. It would utilize crude oil from not just the nearby Barmer fields, but also from other parts of the country and even abroad transported via pipelines.

3633,Nishant  Chhabra,"After an intense battle in the Gujarat Assembly elections, the Congress and the BJP will now take on each other in Rajasthan in two Lok Sabha and one assembly seat. These by-polls are being seen as the semi-finals of the Assembly elections that are due to be held later this year in the State.Both the parties, the  BJP and the Congress,  have announced their candidates for the January 29 by-polls to the Alwar and Ajmer Lok Sabha seats and the Mandalgarh Assembly constituency. The by-polls have been necessitated following the death of Ajmer MP Sanwar Lal Jat, Alwar MP Chand Nath, and Mandalgarh MLA Kirti Kumari who all belonged to the ruling BJP in the State. With Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje facing much criticism from within the party, these polls have become an acid test on her  popularity as well. The BJP has fielded Labour Minister Jaswant Singh Yadav in Alwar and former Union minister Sanwar Lal Jat’s son Ramswaroop Lamba in Ajmer. Shakti Singh Hada is the nominee for the Mandalgarh Assembly constituency. The Congress has given a ticket to former MLA Raghu Sharma from the Ajmer parliamentary constituency, while it has fielded Dr. Karan Singh Yadav from Alwar constituency. In Mandalgarh, Vivek Dhakkad is the Congress candidate. The polling is scheduled for January 29, while the counting of votes will take place on February 1.  Two doctors from the Yadav community are set to test their political fortunes in the  Alwar parliamentary constituency. Caste factor is to dominate the Alwar contest there is a subtext of doctor vs doctor.  Maximum number of voters in the constituency are Yadavs and both the doctors had started campaigning in the area even before the names were finalised by their respective parties. Dr. Karan Yadav is a former MP who defeated Chand Nath in the 2004 general elections from Alwar. He has also been a two-time MLA from Behror and has served as a superintendent of state-run SMS Hospital in Jaipur between 1998 and 2003. After he joined the Congress, he won state assembly elections from Alwar's Behror constituency and parliamentary elections from the Alwar seat. On the other hand,  Dr. Jaswant Yadav holds a bachelor of Ayurveda, medicine and surgery (BAMS) degree and is a state Cabinet Minister and MLA from Behror. There are eight state Assembly segments in Alwar Lok Sabha seat, accommodating nearly 18.27 lakh voters. Nearly a fourth of the voters in Alwar belong to the Yadav community. Other communities with significant presence are  Meos, Dalits and Brahmins. During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections Ajmer witnessed a high-profile contest between the former Union Minister  Sachin Pilot-- who now heads the Congress in Rajasthan-- and late Sanwar Lal Jat. Jat then had defeated  Pilot by a margin of 1,71,983 votes. The BJP, with a hope to encash the sympathy wave in Ajmer, has fielded  Ramswarup Lamba, the son of the late Jat who passed away in August last year.  Raghu Sharma, the Congress candidate is  a former MLA from Kekri in Ajmer district and has served as chief whip of the party in the Rajasthan Assembly in the past. A PhD holder, Sharma understands constituency's  caste equations and Ajmer is his district. Congress candidate Vivek Dhakkad will fight the election against BJP’s Shakti Singh Hada, the current Zila Pramukh of Bhilwara. Vivek Dhakar was defeated by Kirti Kumari in 2013 state Assembly elections by a margin of nearly 19,000. Many believed that Kirti Kumari managed the victory riding the   wave that helped BJP sweep the elections across the country at the time. Vivek Dhakkad holds an LLB degree and did his MBA from Punjab Technical University. Mandalgarh assembly seat fell vacant following Kirti Kumari's death, suspected to be due to dengue, in August.

Speaking during the 72nd foundation day ceremony of the University of Rajasthan in Jaipur on Monday the Minister asserted that Brahmagupta-II came up with the gravitation law a thousand years ago.“We all have studied that Newton gave the law of gravitation, but delving deeper, we can find that Brahmagupta-II came up with the theory of gravitation 1,000 years before (Newton). Why don’t we include this fact in the curriculum?” Devnani asked. The State's Primary and Secondary Education Minister said the school curriculum was revised to accommodate nearly 200 Indian personalities, including the warrior king Maharana Pratap. The minister also stressed that education should be value-based. Making a reference to student leader of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Kanhaiya Kumar, the   (BJP) leader said, “No Kanhaiya should be born in Rajasthan. The university should keep that thing in mind. They are anti-social elements of society”. Kanhaiya Kumar, a student leader, was arrested in 2016 in connection with a case of alleged sedition and criminal conspiracy over the holding of an event in JNU protesting against hanging of parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. Devnani, a BJP legislator from Ajmer,  is not new to controversies. Last year, citing a research website,  he had claimed that cow was the only animal that exhales oxygen. Devnani, while enunciating the healing powers of the cow,  also had asserted that cold and cough could be healed if one went near a cow as cow dung had vitamin B that soaked up radioactivity.  (With Agency Inputs) ",2018-01-09 19:20:00+05:30,," Rajasthan Minister at it again!

""We respect the Supreme Court's decision,"" he said. Law Minister Rajendra Rathore said his department would ""study the court order and only after that a decision on revision can be taken"".

The Karni Sena, the fringe group that led protests against the film, asserted it would not allow 'Padmaavat' to be screened. Its president Mahipal Singh Makrana said the Rajputs would hit the streets against it. ""There will be a janta curfew. Cinema hall owners are supporting us.

3643,Swapna Mohanty,"A transparent and corruption-free government is a prerequisite for any nation to flourish. And the Right to Information (RTI) is a sure ingredient to transparency. While the world over 100 countries have passed the bill and implemented the provisions which state that ""all persons shall have the right to information” Ghana, a leading African nation, has been trying in vain to implement the bill since 1999. In a recent development, the Ghanaian Parliament has proposed a new deadline for its enactment-- July 2018.India's RTI Act is ranked fourth best in the world. It is not easy to bring in transparency laws in any country and the long struggles of the leading lights behind the campaign for right to information legislation in India like Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) and many others, vouchsafe for this. To know more about the status of RTI the world over and Ghana’s long-pending bill, we spoke to Dey. “It is fear the of exposure and unearthing of the scandals which are seemingly holding back the Ghanaians from adopting the Act,” Dey noted. “There is an RTI coalition that is working extensively to pass this bill. There has been a lot of effort and in the year 2016-2017, as far as I can remember, the bill was proposed to be introduced and passed in Parliament. However, there are a lot of scandals that exist in the Ghanaian Parliament. The fear of eruption of a series of such scandals has been a major reason for the delay,” Dey said. Curiously enough, Ghana was the first country to initiate the RTI bill back in 1999. Now it has been left behind by many others. Countries around it and other countries in Africa, which appreciated Ghana in the past for its imitative on the RTI front, have now gone ahead to put the law in place. As per the record, over the period of six-years, the number of countries that have passed the RTI Bill has increased from 6 to 21. Ghana's own neighbors like Togo, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Niger, and Guinea have the RTI legislation implemented. This year, on May 2 and May 3, Ghana would be hosting ‘World Press Freedom Day' gathering and this has attracted some criticism. The Media Foundation for West Africa has been a long-term supporter of the pending RTI bill. The Media Foundation’s editorial notes that it would be embarrassing for Ghana to host the World Press Freedom Day without passing the Right to Information (RTI) Bill. Despite a series of demonstrations on the streets of Ghana in the past 19 years, the RTI bill remains on paper. First drafted in 1999, the bill was not presented in Parliament for many years. Attempts were made in 2003, 2005 and 2007 to introduce it but failed. The first serious attempt at enacting the law was made when the bill was presented to Parliament on February 5, 2010. Unfortunately, the debate on the legislation failed to take it forward. There has never been a valid reason for the failure of its enactment though a lot political blame-game has been doing rounds. While the majority group in Ghanaian Parliament accuses the minority of not showing commitment, the opposition holds the ruling group responsible for the delay. However, it is obvious that the previous government, which was in power from 2012 to 2017, failed to fulfill its electoral commitment on RTI. In fact the then President John Mahama tried to pass the bill before the dissolution of the 6th Parliament but did not succeed. Speaking at the Presidential ‘encounters’, President Mahama said he cannot force Parliament to pass the Bill into law. In his final speech, he said, “I can’t force the Parliament to pass it.” Taking over on January 7, 2017, the new President, Nana Akufo-Addo promised the passage of the bill by the end of the year but he too did not keep his word. The new deadline to approve the bill by the Ghanaian Parliament is July 2018. However, even this time, there has not been any concrete commitment from the government side. On February 1, 2018, the first Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Joseph Osei Owusu, suggested that the Parliament does not consider the Right to Information (RTI) Bill a priority provoking uproar in the House and outside.",2018-02-06 19:36:00+05:30,," Ghana, still wavering on RTI front | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

3651,Anurag Dey,"In a historic judgment, the Supreme Court held the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right and gave sanction to passive euthanasia and living will.  Pronouncing the judgment, a Bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra laid down guidelines governing execution and enforcement of living wills and the procedure to be followed for passive euthanasia. “To deprive an individual of dignity at the end of life is to deprive him of meaningful existence,” the Bench said. The landmark verdict by the Constitution Bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra, Justices AK Sikri, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Ashok Bhushan came in a public interest litigation filed by NGO Common Cause seeking legal recognition for ‘living will’ in India. The petitioner through counsel Prashant Bhushan had sought suitable procedures to ensure that terminally ill patient or those in persistent vegetative state are not deprived of their rights to refuse cruel and unwanted medical treatment like feeding through hydration tubes, or being kept on ventilator and other life support machines in order to artificially prolong their natural life span. The petition sought for a mechanism for allowing patient to execute a document 'My Living Will and Attorney Authorisation' that can be presented to hospitals expressing their wishes as to the medical treatment they would like to receive if they go into persistent vegetative state. A Bench of then Chief Justice P Sathasivam in 2014 had referred the case to the Constitution Bench to resolve inconsistencies between the Division Bench judgment in Aruna Shanbaug case (2011), which allowed passive euthanasia under certain safeguards, and the Constitution Bench judgment in Gian Kaur (1996), which held that the right to life does not include the right to die. In the Aruna Shanbaug case, the Supreme Court allowed passive euthanasia “under exceptional circumstances and under the strict monitoring of the Court”. It also laid down the difference between active and passive euthanasia observing that in active euthanasia something is done to end the patient’s life while in passive euthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient’s life. Delivering separate but concurrent judgments, the court said the life support can be removed only after the statutory medical board declares the patient to be incurable and directed the guidelines and directives so laid down shall be effective till a legislation was enacted for the purpose.By executing a living will, a person with deteriorating health or the terminally ill can express his willingness to not remain in a vegetative state with life support system if he/she goes into a state when it will not be possible for them to express their wishes.  It allows a patient to give explicit instructions in advance about the medical treatment to be administered when he or she is terminally ill or no longer able to express informed consent. It also includes authorising a family to switch off life support in case a medical board declared that a patient is beyond medical help.  The document can be presented to a hospital for appropriate action in the event the executant’s health worsens. The government had opposed the concept of Living Will on the grounds that people opting for it may not be aware of future medical advancements. There have been   s of people approaching the court or the government seeking euthanasia for their near and dear ones including a man from Agra seeking death for six of his children diagnosed with a rare disease. The Law Commission of India first in March  and subsequently in August   had recommended a Bill to provide for the protection of patients and medical practitioners from liability in the context of withholding or withdrawing medical treatment including life support systems from patients who are terminally-ill.  Acting on the recommendations only in 2016, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare released the draft Medical Treatment of Terminally-ill Patients (Protection of Patients and Medical Practitioners) Bill on May 9, inviting suggestions. The draft Bill provides protection to patients and medical practitioners (from liability) for withdrawing medical treatment of terminally ill patients. Key provisions of the draft Bill include:  Every competent patient (including minors above the age of 16 years) will have the right to decide and request the medical practitioner to withhold, withdraw, or continue medical treatment in case of a terminal illness. The practitioner will act on the request if he is satisfied that the patient is competent to take an informed decision. In case of minors above 16 years, the consent of the parent and the major spouse will also be required. Before proceeding with the decision, the medical practitioner will be required to inform persons including the spouse, or parent, etc of the need (or otherwise) for withdrawing treatment.  If a patient suffering from terminal illness refuses medical treatment, he will not be liable for an offence under the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Without regard to provisions in any other law, in cases where a medical practitioner withdraws treatment on the request of a patient, his action will be lawful.  In case of an incompetent patient (persons of unsound mind, etc), a near relative, medical practitioner etc, can apply to the High Court for granting permission to withdraw or withhold medical treatment.",2018-03-09 17:29:00+05:30,, SC allows passive euthanasia.

3652,Charu Kartikeya,"What has long been evident in the Congress party's conduct has just been confirmed by none other than the authority who lorded over the party for 19 long years. , who stepped down as Congress president just last year, has said in an interview that the recent temple-hopping by her son and successor  , is a response to the BJP's success in convincing Indian voters that the Congress is “a Muslim party”. “I wouldn't say brainwash. Its a rude word. But the BJP has succeeded in convincing the people that Congress is a Muslim party,” Gandhi said, responding to a question on whether her party is practicing “soft-Hindutva”. Notably, she said nothing to deny the “soft-Hindutva” strategy and instead quickly presented her defense, stressing that “Most people in our party are Hindus”. Rahul Gandhi's advisers appear to have prescribed temple visits as political strategy sometime in late 2014. From 2015,  at well-known centres of Hinduism, including Kashi Vishwanath temple in Varanasi, Kamakhya temple in Assam and Badrinath and Kedarnath temples in Uttarakhand.  These were not private visits as they were widely publicised by the party itself, leading to ample media coverage. Many believe the strategy partly paid-off when the party managed to inch very close to the ruling BJP's performance in Gujarat Assembly polls, in December 2017. Convinced that the strategy is working, Rahul Gandhi has been visiting temples again in Karnataka, all set to go to polls soon. So far, he and other leaders of his party did not admit that this was a considered strategy, with Gandhi himself retorting every time he was asked about these visits that is he not allowed to visit temples? His mother's statements mark the first time that top leadership of the party has admitted that the party is consciously trying to improve its image among those for whom visiting temples is important. Significantly, Gandhi said Congress leaders including herself used to visit temples earlier too but never made a show of it. That they have decided to openly demonstrate a love for Hindu practices is a landmark moment. It shows that Congress has formally accepted that among the most significant reasons responsible for its defeat in the last Lok Sabha polls is the perception that it had positioned itself too close to India's religious minorities. This was not just the BJP's allegation against Congress, it was also the view privately held by many Congress leaders as well as party-workers. The AK Antony committee's internal report, which was leaked, reportedly said that a perception of minority-appeasement proved to be the party's  .  Sonia Gandhi is not the Congress president anymore but she is still the chairperson of the Congress Parliamentary Party. Her comments have made it clear that the party indeed took the post-2014 analysis seriously and is still working to reverse that perception. What needs to be considered is will this manifest only in temple visits or will it impact other aspects of the party's electoral strategy too? The Sangh Parivar's vicious political tools of gau-raksha, love-jihad and ghar-wapsi have left the Muslims in a deeply vulnerable position. Further, the BJP winning polls after polls even after refusing to give tickets to Muslims to contest is also leading to their electoral marginalisation. Things have now come to such a pass that RSS is openly revealing its military ambition and RSS-cheerleaders are threatening bloodshed and civil war. It is important in these times for the right-wing to be contested, electorally as well as socially. With the electoral decline of the Left, this onerous task has fallen on the shoulders of the Congress party and regional satraps committed to secular politics. In such times, it is as important for the Congress to recover electoral ground as it is to assure the minorities of solidarity. It will be tricky for the party to do so while appealing to Hindus by visiting temples.",2018-03-09 18:39:00+05:30,, Sonia Gandhi confirms Congress' soft-Hindutva strategy first time ever  | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
3653,Sulagna Sengupta,"The forthcoming elections to the upper house of Parliament has exposed strange faultlines in West Bengal politics.  As Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee announced that Trinamool Congress would throw in its extra votes for Abhishek Manu Singhvi of  , it became clear that the Grand Old Party's High Command and state unit were not on the same page. The same can be said about the Communist Party of India (Marxist).There was no official announcement of Singhvi's candidature from the Congress when Banerjee declared her support for him at a Trinamool event. It left WB Pradesh Congress Commitee chief Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury somewhat red-faced. Chowdhury had publicly invited the CPM to put up General Secretary   as candidate, an idea widely popular with the Bengal unit of the Left party. In fact, earlier, the Congress High Command also seemed to be favourable to this idea. But the deep divide within CPM on accepting Congress support led to a dead end. Even then Chowdhury had continued to push for Yechury in a bid. “We feel Sitaram Yechury is the right person to contest for the fifth seat from Bengal. We told Yechuryji Tursday that we will support him if he contests; but he was unwilling,” the Bengal Congress leader said.  Chowdhury went on to say that though the state Congress proposed Yechury's name, the party high command “unanimously” decided on Singhvi. The state unit, according to its chief, was left with no option but to back the lawyer-politician.  Yechury has had a long stint at the Council of States representing Bengal, himself was reportedly not averse to the idea. But his rival faction, led by Prakash Karat, put its foot down. Like Chowdhury-led Bengal Congress, a section of the CPM in the state favour an alliance to take on Trinamool. The two parties, once bitter rivals, have drastically lost political space to Banerjee, reflected by her party's might in the Assembly – 213 of 294 seats. The Congress has 42 members in the House while the CPM – the erstwhile ruling party – was reduced to 26 MLAs after the 2016 elections.  State politics apart, Yechury is also popular cutting across party line for his effective intervention in House debates. The veteran CPM leader has earned kudos for putting the Opposition's point across in a largely saffron Parliament. Yechury has also been known as an ardent backer of Opposition unity against the  , reminiscent of his predecessor Harkishen Singh Surjeet whose support to the United Progressive Alliance was instrumental in ensuring  's first term as Prime Minister. Surjeet was CPM general secretary from 1992 to 2005, when Karat took over. Karat's term until 2015 saw the party withdrawing support to the Centre and reinquishing power in Bengal. In general, there was a move away from alliances with non-Left parties. This trend has drawn wide support from the Kerala unit of CPM, which still counts Congress as its main rival. The Kerala and Bengal factions have been head-to-head on issues several times in the recent past.  In effect, this clash of political lines put paid any hope of Yechury as candidate and the party hurriedly announced the candidature of veteran Kolkata-based politician Robin Deb. “We can't bypass the Central Committee's decision,” Biman Bose, secretary of CPM's West Bengal State Committee. He also highlighted that there was hardly any choice after Congress opted for Singhvi.  Deb is set to file his nomination for the 23 March polls, but is sure to lose to Singhvi. Of the five Rajya Sabha berths up for grab from Bengal, Trinamool has enough seats to muscle through four and then some. For the fifth seat though, no party has enough numbers.  A possible Congress-CPM combine could have kept the seat with the state Opposition. But Banerjee's decision to pool her extra votes for Congress has tilted the balance and opened up new political possibilities. A Trinamool-Congress understanding may emerge as important after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The two parties have earlier cooperated to get dethrone CPM in Bengal (2011) and now have a common enemy in the BJP. While the Congress is eager to wrest back power next year, it knows how difficult the task would be without allies. Banerjee, on the other hand, has seen the saffron party rushing in to fill the vaccum left behind by the CPM.  “Banerjee's main aim is to wipe out the BJP, which is playing communal politics. We will leave no stones unturned,” a senior Trinamool leader said. Chowdhury maintained that it was “too early” to talk about a collaboration. Understandable, considering his priority: to revive state Congress. The high command though may have other priorities. ",2018-03-10 16:59:00+05:30,, Mamata's support for Singhvi opens up new possibilities and faultlines | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

3657,Ramakrishna Upadhya,"The writing is clearly on the wall. Generally, no single issue can substantially alter the outcome of an election. But, Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah’s great gamble in splitting the Lingayat community could either make or break the Congress party’s fortunes in the Assembly elections, due in less than two months. The state Cabinet this week decided to recommend to the Centre that Lingayats be recognised as a religion separate from Hindus, and they be accorded minority status. This has sent tremors both in the Congress and BJP circles as such a move can have far-reaching implications on elections across the state. The Veerashaiva-Lingayats – who constitute the single-largest community accounting for 17% of the state’s population – have the potential to sway the results in as many as 130 out of 224 constituencies. That is slightly more than what is required for a clear majority. Lingayats were traditional supporters of the Congress – Six Karnata chief ministers from the Congress, including S Nijalingappa, BD Jatti, SR Kanti and Veerendra Patil, were Lingayats.  But the community also played a major role in ousting the Grand Old Party from power. In 1980 Lingayats switched loyalties to Janata Parivar and solidly backed Ramakrishna Hegde (a Brahmin, whom the Lingayats trusted) and JH Patel (a Lingayat). When the Janata experiment crumbled, the Congress brought back Veerendra Patil as Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president. He won an unprecedented mandate, winning 181 seats in the 1989 Assmbly elections. After being in disarray for a decade-and-a-half the Lingayats regrouped and found a saviour in BS Yeddyurappa, who opened the gates to South India for the   in 2008. He may have lost power as chief minister after being embroiled in corruption charges, but to this day, he remains the undisputed leader of the Lingayat community. Siddaramaiah is all too conscious of the fact that the Congress could never have won the 2013 Assembly elections but for Yeddyurappa. Miffed at being asked to resign as CM, he quit the BJP and put up candidates under the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) banner. As a result, the BJP was down to 40 seats from 110. The KJP managed only five seats, but Yeddyurappa drew nearly 10% of the votes, helping catapult the Congress to power. Siddaramaiah’s supporters love to compare him to D Devraj Urs, one of the best and shrewdest CMs Karnataka has had. Urs hailed from a miniscule minority Kshatriya community, but the social engineering he achieved under tremendous odds kept him in power for eight years. He would have continued longer had he not developed national ambitions and lost focus. In comparison, Siddaramaiah, though an able administrator, has shown castiest tendencies. He has foisted officials from his Kuruba community in many key positions, earning the wrath of major communities like Vokkaliga and Lingayat. The Vokkaligas constitute nearly 12% of the state's population and are predominantly settled in old Mysore areas. They look upon former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda as their messiah – the only reason why the   (Secular) still remains relevant and a force to reckon with. Positioning himself as a leader of ‘Ahinda’ (an acronym for backward classes, scheduled castes, tribes and muslims), Siddaramaiah has retained for Congress a vote base, but it is not sufficient to go past the winning post. Even within this ‘vote bank,’ the Madigas – a large scheduled caste – is unhappy at not being given adequate reservation in jobs and educational institutions as recommended by a judicial commission. Yeddyurappa returned to the BJP just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, and two years ago the party unequivocally him as its chief ministerial candidate. This would have led Siddaramaiah to calculate that unless he turned a chunk of Lingayat votes towards the Congress, the party could not be sure of victory. The BJP began to consolidate Lingayat votes by projecting 12th century reformer Basaveshwara or Basavanna – the community's spiritual and philosophical leader – at national and international levels. Prime Minister   unveiled Basaveshwara’s bust in London and followed it up by releasing volumes of Basavanna’s Vachanas (prose-poetry) in 23 different languages.  After this Siddaramaiah suddenly ordered all state government offices to display Basavanna’s photos along with other leaders. This move drew accolades from all sides. For the Congress, it was the beginning of the appropriation of Basavanna's legacy.  At one of the felicitation functions that followed, a section of Lingayats raised the demand for a separate status for the community, which has often been voiced over the last 75 years without much success. As Siddaramaiah and his think tank mulled over the issue, they saw a golden opportunity to create a wedge in the Lingayat community and strike at this strong vote base of the BJP. MB Patil, Basavaraj Rayareddy and Vinay Kulkarni, the Lingayat faces in the Cabinet, were deployed to draw favourably inclined heads of Lingayat mutts to organise huge rallies across the state to mobilise public support.  The heads of powerful mutts such as Siddaganga and Suttur, who have huge followers because of their educational and philanthropic activities, quietly opposed the move to split the community but did not come out in the open. Thus, Siddaramaiah’s desire to obtain a ‘consensus’ before taking a decision failed. There was intense division within the Cabinet and a decision on splitting the Lingayats was twice postponed. A nervous Congress high command asked Siddaramaiah to exercise caution, but as the CM of the only large state Congress still controls, Siddaramaiah had his way. To assuage the feelings of those who were opposed to the move, the cabinet decided that apart from Lingayats even Veerashaivas who believed in Basavanna’s teachings, could be members of the new minority religion. The Karnataka government will soon put the ball in the Centre’s court as recognising any group as a religious minority requires a long legal process, including approval by Parliament. “If a group of Lingayats want to declare themselves as a separate faith, they can do so and the state will have no role in it. People have the right to follow any faith they believe in,” Senior Supreme Court advocate Mohan Katharki said.  “But, if the Lingayats want to be recognised as a religious minority, the power lies with the Centre under Sec 2 (f) of the National Commission for Minority Educational Act of 2004,” he pointed out. The Karnataka Veerashaiva Mahasabha, which had initially welcomed the government’s decision, did a U-turn after consulting some heads of religious mutts. It said it could never accept the decision to be part of a separate religion. Basavanna, the 12th century reformer, revolted against Brahminism and tried to introduce a classless, casteless homogeneity among people. He firmly believed in humanity as one religion, but ironically, over a period of time, his followers began to identify themselves as Veerashaivas or Lingayats within the Hindu fold. The proponents of ‘Lingayatism’ as a separate religion are holding out the carrot of special privileges once they are recognised as a ‘minority,’ along with five other minority groups, including Muslims, Christians and Jains. But it is well recognised that Lingayats have been an integral part of the Hindu society, worshipping Hindu gods, visiting temples and following Hindu practices.  In fact, in 2013, the UPA government rejected a request made by the Veerashiva Mahasabha for a separate religion status. The Registrar General of India, who had been consulted, noted that “Veerashaiva-Lingayat is a sect of the Hindu and not an independent religion”.  If Siddaramaiah has been embarrassed at the disclosure that the Congress-led UPA had itself turned down the demand for a separate religion for Lingayats, he has not been showing it. He is hoping that the “perception” that his government did its best for Lingayats will bring his party the electoral dividends. The state BJP, which has been treading cautiously on the issue so far, may try to turn the tables on Siddaramaiah by accusing him of dividing the Hindus. There is already a lot of anger and confusion among the Lingayats and they are worried that even families are being torn asunder. “I have been happily married for over 30 years and after this controversy broke, we are suddenly made to realise that my wife is a Veerashaiva and I’m a Lingayat. Why are we made to go through this agony?” a Lingayat professor wrote. “Over 90% of Veerashaivas and Lingayats are confused. The politics of the country has bombed a peace-loving community,” another social worker claimed. The BJP is bound to exploit such sentiments. Ultimately, the political churning in the Lingayat community over the next six-seven weeks will decide whether Siddaramaiah-led Congress will harvest a bumper crop of votes or a boomerang.",2018-03-24 16:19:00+05:30,, Siddaramaiah's great Lingayat gamble: Will it work | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
3658,Catch Team,"That Ram Navami celebrations would take a political turn in West Bengal was known, but that politics would be fatal was not. Sunday at least one person died in the state as the ruling Trinamool Congress and the saffron challengers clashed with each other in various places.  Both the parties took out colourful processions – there were decked-up chariots with Ram idols, making leaders offerings and chants of Jai ShriRam.The electronic media broadcast footages of rallies by the BJP and Bajrang Dal where arms were being flaunted. Some grabs showed even children carrying swords. The state  government had already issued prohibitary warnings against carrying arms while state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh had claimed the party woun't pay heed to such warnings. As the day progressed, reports of clashed started pouring in. In Purulia district's Beldi workers of both parties clashed after taking out processions. BJP workers were reportedly armed here too. When the police tried to rein the situation in five personnel were injured. Eventually, in the evening, news agency ANI reported of one death. In North 24 Paragana district's Dum Dum, adjacent to Capital Kolkata, the police stopped a Trinamool rally where some were carrying wooden sticks. In Habra (the same disctrict) Trinamool and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangha activists clashed. There were also reports of violence from Burdwan district too. At several places, BJP leaders were spotted with arms, including in Chinsurah and other places in Hooghly district and in Birbhum and Purulia districts. Party chief Ghosh stuck to his guns and carried a mace first and then a sword. He was also seen wielding sticks on camera. Mukul Roy, the BJP's prize catch from Trinamool, was also seen brandishing a sword. Actor Locket Chatterjee tweeted a photo, holding a trishul. Traditionally, Ram Navami hasn't been celebrated publicly in Bengal. It was the BJP, which made a spectacle out of it   and scored a political point. Desperate to gain electorally in the state, the party has hardly missed a chance to accuse Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of 'minority appeasement' and not protecting the interests of 'majority Hindus'. Going by bye-poll results, its efforts have not gone waste as the saffronites have rised steadily to second spots, displacing the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress. In response, the Trinamool has tried to beat the BJP in its own game. Banerjee's and his nephew Abhishek's photographs have increasingly been spotted at celebratory banners for various festivals. Sunday's Ram Navami showdown was perhaps a culmination of that process. Birbhum district's Trinamool strongman Anubrata Mondal claimed the party's processions were to bring harmony. “We do not show case arms. The BJP is trying to create violence by carrying sharp weapons,” he said. Whatever the party might say, the Sangh Parivar called Trinamool's participation in Ram Navami celebration as a victory of its Hindutva agenda. In fact, the right wing and the left wing seemed to agree on this as this tweet by CPI (M) leader Surjya Kanta Mishra. The only difference between Trinamool and BJP rallies seemed to be weapons. Ghosh justified that by calling it an “old tradition” that “Trinamool is not aware of”. Roy too put in his two bits calling the weapons “mere symbols”. But like last year, armed children at rallies pointed to a disturbing trend. At various rallies of Bajrang Dal in Purulia and South Dinajpur districts this was seen. In Purulia, the district administration intervened and a rally was stopped. Social activists have questioned this trend. “This is horrifying and against the Juvenile Justice Act. Children are being used by a political party to carry out their political agenda and people need to raise their voice against it,” Ananya Chatterjee, chairperson of West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said.",2018-03-25 21:52:00+05:30,," Trinamool, BJP Ram Navami showdown kills one in Bengal | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

3660,Riyaz Wani,"Even by Kashmiri standards where more and more youth taking up the gun now hardly attracts any notice, this is unthinkable: for the first time a top separatist leader’s son has joined militancy. Junaid Ashraf Khan, son of Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, the newly appointed chief of separatist oufit Tehreek-i-Hurriyat, went missing on Friday after he left his home at Srinagar’s Baghat area for Friday prayers.  The Family lodged a missing report at the nearby police station. But as has by now become a familiar turn of events, a picture of Khan brandishing a Kalashankov went viral across social media. The picture had his address and his father’s name emblazoned across it. Khan has joined Hizbul Mujahideen, the pro-Pakistan militant outfit.  When contacted, a family member refused to talk, saying they were “too much in shock to say anything about the development”.  “Think about our state of mind,” he said.  Soon after his taking over as the TeH chief, Sehrai had expressed himself against the advent of Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Kashmir, saying the Kashmir cause had nothing to do with any organisation espousing a global agenda. “Our agenda is simple. We only want Kashmir to be free from Indian occupation. Nothing else,” Sehrai had said in an interview to a local daily. “Daesh and Al-Qaida have nothing to do with our movement and we will never accept them”. Sehrai had also urged Zakir Musa, chief of Ansar Gazwat-ul-Hind, an al-Qaeda affiliate, to shun his extremist ideology. “Zakir Musa is the light of my eyes. He left everything for a sacred cause. But I want to tell him that by moving towards extremism he was doing India a favour,” Sehrai said.  Two days later, his son, an MBA, took up arms and it stunned Kashmir. Security agencies too. Jammu and Kashmir Police Director-General SP Vaid termed the development “unfortunate”. He was quick to urge Sehrai to persuade his son to return and set an example for others to follow. “I urge Sehrai that since he is in command, he should appeal his son and other local boys wielding guns to return. He should himself take a lead in entering into a dialogue so that youth of Kashmir are saved from the path of violence,” Vaid said. The development has also set social media talking. The drift of the conversation has largely favoured Khan’s decision, with a minority view expressing concern at the troubling new direction that Kashmir was taking. “Now no 1 can say huriyat leaders settle their family outside n play with future of others (sic),” posted one user on Facebook while sharing Khan’s picture.  “(Khan’s joining militancy) sets a new bar for #Kashmir separatist leadership. May catapult #Sehrai to a level where his leadership remains undisputed. A possible flip to militancy also (sic),” tweeted another. ”Now what will india counter this with. Situation is literally out of control in kashmir or can we say India has lost kashmir. Axed it's own toes by using policy of iron fist in Kashmir (sic),” tweeted yet another. The unusual development has cast a renewed spotlight on the trend of the local youth joining militancy. A phenomenon that seemed to have been largely confined to the interiors of the countryside in South Kashmir is now radiating out to the urban centres including Srinagar. The trend is also creeping up the social ladder with the youth which are highly educated and belong to affluent and apparently insulated families also taking the plunge. Sehrai’s is one such family.  A few months ago, Mannan Wani, a PhD student from Aligarh Muslim University, joined Hizbul Mujahideen. Incidentally, Wani hails from Tikipora, Kupwara, Sehrai’s ancestral village. Sehrai, seen as successor to separatist patriarch Syed Ali Shah Geelani, is unlikely to go against his son’s decision, as doing so will run counter to his long-held political beliefs and that of the ideological stance of Hurriyat G, a powerful hardline secessionist alliance of which TeH is a constituent. Though a professed votary for a peaceful political movement for Kashmir’s merger with Pakistan, Hurriyat G has traditionally rationalised the militant struggle as a course of action forced upon the youth by “India’s intransigence”. In his statements, Sehrai has defended the political and militant struggle as essential to the achievement of goal of Azadi.  At the same time, having a son as a militant will substantially boost Sehrai’s moral stature as a separatist leader in Valley. It has, for once, dented the argument that the separatist leaders preached jihad to neighbours’ kids and saved their own.  “Ashraf Sehrai’s son joins Militant ranks, breaking the norm that separatists enjoy ravishly while others die,” tweeted Jibran Asim. Earlier, it were only the militant leaders from Pakistan who are known to send their children to fight in Kashmir. Among them is the Mumbai attack mastermind Zakiur-Rehman Lakhvi and Abdur Rehman Makki, second-in-command in Jamat-u-Dawa headed by Hafiz Saeed. While Lakhvi’s 20-year-old son Mohammad Qasim was killed way back in 2007 in an encounter in Bandipore area, Makki’s two sons – Abu Musaib and Abu Owaid – were killed in 2017.",2018-03-26 01:36:00+05:30,, Hurriyat chief's son picks up gun.

3661,Neeraj Thakur,"It has been two-and-a-half centuries since Adam Smith laid down the foundation of free-market economic theory in his 'Wealth of Nations'. And in comes Surjit Bhalla, member of Prime Minister  's Economic Advisoty Council, to tell us that “The Times Are Changing”. Smith's magnum opus told future governments – essentially looking to grow the size of their economies – to allow people to pursue their self interest without any external intervention, and everything will fall in place. As the Western world pursued that wisdom of it became the wealthiest, most prosperous and advanced. At the moment, though, the western economies are engaged in a struggle for supremacy with those on the eastern hemisphare. Old rules no longer apply, according to Bhalla in his 'The New Wealth of Nations', 242 years after Smith's tome. Those who regularly read Bhalla's columns in the Indian Express know his way of prescribing One cure for all ills. (Read It’s interest rates, stupid). Smith explained each and every aspect of the human nature to justify his free-market theory. Bhalla though keeps his arguments, short, linear and oversimplified to argue about the power of Mother Nature and how it is out to create balance in the society, to reduce much-cursed inequality to the lowest-ever level by as early as 2030.The richest 1% in the world garnered 82% of all its new wealth generated, according to not-for profit Oxfam’s report 'Reward Work, Not Wealth' (2018), based on data collected by Credit Suisse. The 2008 financial crisis led elite institutions like World Bank to pressure governments to look for ways to reduce the wealth effect over the livelihood of people. The Oxfam report argued that the world economy favours those living off the wealth generated from assets. There is limited remuneration for labour in this world. In order to destroy this argument, Bhalla has come up with his own methodology and definitions. (He uses data until 2015) “ What is Income?” asks Bhalla. “A flow of money from an asset. What is an asset? Wealth is. Anything that yields a flow of income is wealth. Therefore, land or a house is an asset because it yields a flow of income. Cows that give you milk are wealth (some Hindus consider the cow an asset superior to all other forms of wealth). Why have parents invested in their children’s educations? Precisely for the same reason because it is an asset,” argues Bhalla to establish that this world possess more wealth in the form of education than in the form of financial wealth. Point taken. Education is wealth and the more educated the people in the country the higher the wealthier are its people. “In 1870, 225 of the population had obtained primary education in Great Britian; the comparable number for the US-58%. Evidently, the UK was richer by about 25%,” says Bhalla.  But the bone of contention is not wealth, it is inequality. Even in the wealthiest of the countries, inequality is the most dreaded monster for administrators. The history of modern world revolutions (1789 to 1848) was the history of the middle and the working class revolting against income inequality. “ How can the government deal with the wage stagnation that follows equality in education? Bhalla addresses the issue of oversupply of educated people in his last chapter: “Imagine a world where everybody broadly has the same level of education. It is not utopia I am talking about; it is the present day reality in the Western World. There is education inequality in the West, but broadly of an irreducible nature.” The world that Bhalla imagines is one where people are equal – not because of equal rise in their incomes but because of a secular rise in joblessness. “What is very likely to become centre-stage, and with equal applicability in both developed and developing economies, is the new curse of progress –large-scale, unemployment or minimal employment.” The cure for a world less unequal and more unemployed is adoption of basic income. Though the idea was recently defeated in a referendum held in Switzerland, Bhalla says: “don't fight the irresistible force of Mother Nature.” Bhalla's prognosis sees the bottom 50% of the world's population living without or minimal employment, requiring basic minimum. The question that follows Bhalla's hypothesis is, would this new kind of equality among the bottom 50% lead to calm or a new found solidarity to overthrow the elites? Bhalla has an image of a contrarian in the world of economics. He always challenges the popular beliefs – be it his argument on schemes like MNREGA or farm sector distress in India – but he does it with smart use of data. But in the last chapter of this book, out of nowhere, Bhalla suddenly takes a plunge into the Indian politics. He argues that education in India has created new political class. “Mr Modi is the son of a chaiwallah (a tea-seller): the previous elites were upper class Hindus and most belonged to the highest Brahmin caste,” says Bhalla. While the author is right on the birth of new elites for sure. But given the controversies that have surrounded the educational qualifications of Modi and his ministers, and the kind of unscientific statements given by them in the four years of their rule, makes it difficult to believe that all this is a result of increasing educational wealth of the country. It make sense for the readers to indulge only in the first 11 chapters of the book, where Bhalla is cogent on the back of diligently worked out data to emphasize the age old adverb popular in Hindi: “ ” (Roughly: Slog, study and you will rule; but making merry is uncool). Nobody in this part of the world doubted that education is wealth of the modern world. Bhalla reaffirms that belief with data. But whether it is enough to keep away the humanity from the eternal desire of equality that led to the 'storming of  Bastille' will be known only over the coming decades.",2018-03-26 03:43:00+05:30,," New Wealth of Nations review: Data delight, debatable prognosis of the future | Catch News",http://www.catchnews.com/

3666,Anurag Dey,"After revealing their candidates for the upcoming elections to the Karnataka elections, the   and the   have turned their focus to picking faults at each others' candidates. The BJP has already faced flak for naming G Somashekhara Reddy, brother of mining baron G Janardhana Reddy, in its second list released Monday. Somasekhara, a former state minister, was chargesheeted in 2012 by Andhra Pradesh's Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in the cash-for-bail case involving his brother. Janardhana was indicted in the Bellary illegal mining scam and the related Belekeri port scam. The BJP has also fielded B Sriramulu, a close confidant of Janardhana. It has so far announced candidates for 154 of the 224 seats for which polls will be held May 12. Somashekhara's candidature attracted prompt criticism from the Congress:Tuesday the saffron party hit back at rival Congress over the candidature of HS Chandramouli, lawyer for absconding diamond merchant Mehul Choksi. Parliamentarian and party spokesperson GVL Narsimha Rao alleged the accused in the multi-crore Punjab National Bank fraud case, enjoyed the “patronage” of Congress President  . “Congress’ connections with Mehul Choksi keep on emerging one after the other. One incident can be a coincidence, but multiple coincidences means it is a conspiracy. There is no doubt Choksi enjoyed patronage and support of Rahul Gandhi. “And that is why Congress had rewarded Chandramouli, who as a lawyer defended Mehul Choksi in case involving cheating in 2015,” said Rao. He alleged that the police complaint involving the cheating incident was subsequently converted in a civil complaint at Congress’ insistence. Rao said Chandramouli was also legal consultant of Congress leader KJ George, a prime accused in the case of suicide of deputy superintendent of police MK Ganapathi in 2016. “Since Chandramouli has been making efforts to save one offender after another, he has been rewarded with candidature, which makes us believe that Congress ka haath Mehul Choksi ke saath”, he said.  Citing Rahul Gandhi’s presence at a promotional event of Choksi-owned Gitanjali Jewels in 2013, Rao said: “It not just Rahul Gandhi alone, there is a long list of Congress’ connections with Choksi. In 2013, (former Finance Minister) P Chidambaram removed the director of Allahabad Bank for denying to restructure a loan of Rs 1,550 crore to Choksi when he highlighted the lacunae in it. “Then the premises of Abhishek Manu Singhvi in Mumbai was rented to Choksi and even his wife bought jewellery worth Rs 5 crore from unaccounted cash,” he alleged. Earlier BJP IT Cell head Amit Malviya had questioned the Congress’s move to field Chandramouli instead of Brijesh Kalappa who is Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah’s legal advisor. Kalappa expressed his anguish and disappointment in a Facebook post: “I have been denied LS 2009, 2014. R S in 2014, 16, 18 and now Assembly. “I will swallow the ignominy of being ousted from the race by a Person who joined the Party in 2016, got a Legislative Council Ticket the same year, lost and the same person now bags the Assembly ticket for Madikeri. This begs the question- if one person were given so many opportunities by the Congress Party, why did we let a brilliant person like Jayaprakash Hegde go merely because he wanted the MLC ticket after he lost Lok Sabha elections?! I will try for Gram Panchayat next time,” Kalappa had said in the post. There also have been reports unhappy with the developments, the Congress had put on hold Chandramouli’s candidature. The Congress subsequently dismissed the reports and in turn questioned the BJP’s links with Choksi and former cricket administrator Lalit Modi. “If being an advocate is a charge, then the BJP is liable to answer for Union minister   whose daughter’s legal firm was hired by Choksi.  “They should also answer for External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje for procuring travel documents to Lalit Modi. The BJP should focus on issues faced by the country rather than indulging in diversionary ploys,” said Congress leader Jaiveer Shergil.",2018-04-18 15:03:00+05:30,, BJP returns Congress Reddy Bros attack with Chandramouli-Choksi taunts | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

3670,Sulagna Sengupta,"The Calcutta High Court Tuesday passed an order validating nominations by candidates via electronic mails. It asked the West Bengal Election Commission to accept nominations for Panchayat election filed by 3 pm on 23 April, reacting to a plea by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). The Commission though has decided to move Supreme Court against that. The Division Bench order makes holding polling on 14 May difficult as the commission will now need tota scrutinise the nominations filed over email. After the court order, the   said it would appeal for allowing others to file their nominations via email. Calling the order historic, the party's advocate Pratap Banerjee said: “Around 2,000 nominations could not be filed by various workers of our party due to threats from Trinamool Congress.” The Bench said filing of nominations through email would open up options for voters and reduce risks of loss of life. The legal fraternity seemed to agree that the order was a landmark one, and could give rise to similar demands in other elections across India. “It is historic and can be a legal precedent when situation demands and people are unable to file nominations,” said former Supreme Court judge Ashok Ganguly. “Democracy is in shambles as we heard that people died out of political clash as they could not file nominations. This is not acceptable,” he added. Another senior lawyer said “We feel the state election commission will now be more dutiful.” CPM members expressed satisfaction and said 800 of its candidates couldn't file nominations. Commission officials, however, now face a challenge. They will have to scrutinise fresh nominations and prepare fresh ballots, including for some seats earlier thought to be 'uncontested', a senior official said. This could delay the date of polling. “According to the Panchayat Act, about 21 days are needed between filing of nominations and polling.

3674,Ramin  Jahanbegloo,"It is a sad fact that the conflict in Yemen has killed an estimated 28,033 people since January 2017 and pushed 8.4 million to the brink of famine. Some 50,000 Yemeni children are estimated to have died last year from hunger and preventable disease as a result of what United Nations aid agencies describe as “the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” However, the irony of what is happening in Yemen is that the civil conflict in this country is widely a proxy war between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia established a United States-backed coalition of ten nations in March 2015 and launched an aerial bombing campaign in Yemen to push back the Houthis, an Iran-allied rebel group, who seized control of the capital in September 2014. Since 2015, the United Arab Emirates has been responsible for much of the ground war, particularly in the south and west of the country. More than 22 million Yemenis, three-quarters of the population, are already in need of humanitarian assistance, compounded by restrictions on imports imposed by the Saudi-UAE coalition and a complete blockade on humanitarian aid in response to the Houthis firing ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia.  Saudis have continuously blamed the Islamic Republic of Iran for the Houthis’ missile attacks. The proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has been going on since 2011, following the 'Yemeni Revolution', which prompted regime change. In 2011, the Saudi and the Western world back Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi became head of state after an uprising against former President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011. Three years later, the Houthis and the Iranians helped Saleh to take control of the Yemeni capital Sana'a and government ministries, pushing the Hadi government into exile. But at the end of 2017, Saleh switched sides again, declaring loyalty to the coalition and sparking a battle with the Houthis that ended in his death at their hands. With the death of Saleh, the Yemen war became clearly and profoundly a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. On 19 June, the Saudi led coalition forces announced that they had consolidated their control over Hodeidah airport after a week of fierce fighting with Houthi rebels as part of Operation Golden Victory. Whatever the outcome, the struggle for the city is likely to mark a shift in the essence of the conflict. Though the loss of Hodeidah will not lead to a Houthi surrender, it will certainly leave the Houthis in a weakened position militarily, and the coalition- led forces will have the upper hand in the future negotiations. But the battle for Hodeidah is taking place at a significant cost, while deepening the political stalemate in Yemen and leaving Yemenites with more humanitarian problems. Assuredly, President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the international nuclear accord with Iran in late May exacerbated the conflict in Yemen. Let us not forget that, Yemen’s internationally-recognised government, which has been forced into exile by Houthi advances, praised Trump’s decision to exit the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action or JCPOA. In the eyes of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Emirates, Iran has been spreading its influence in Yemen since the presidency of Barack Obama. The head of the IRGC's Quds Force, Gen. Qasem Soleimani, ordered a step-up in aid to the Houthis, including more advisers and experts on the scene and more ballistic missile technology. According to a report by al-Monitor, the IRGC has also suffered some casualties in Yemen. At least 23 Iranian soldiers have been killed or captured and another 21 Hezbollah fighters have been lost. Yemen is a crucial battlefield to breakdown the Saudi foreign policy in the region. However, the Saudis do not want to get into a direct war with Iran. They know well that though supported by the US, getting into a war with Iran might be easy, it will anything but easy to handle it. United States has a security commitment to Saudi Arabia, but Washington can tolerate a proxy war in Yemen between the Saudis and the Iranians as long as it falls below the threshold of a direct conventional warfare. The Americans and their allies know well that Iran has a strategic vision for the Middle East, which is to hold Shiite dominance over the Persian Gulf, keeping a strong foothold in Yemen via the Houthis and, above all, competing with the Saudi Wahhabi Islam. Most of the analysts of Middle East politics stress that Iran’s real power in the region lies in its capacity to exploit Arab Shias in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon, including the Houthis in Yemen. Contacts between Houthis and Iran are of far lesse importance than Iran’s relation with the Hezbollah in Lebanon. On the other hand, Riyadh accuses Iran of creating a Shiite crescent and interfering in its immediate neighborhood. One way or another, the effects of the proxy war between the Saudis and the Iranians has been absolutely devastating for Yemen and its innocent civilians. Placed within this context, the war in Yemen has become a conflict that, because of its complexity, we have chosen to forget, and which it is important that we remember.",2018-06-23 19:27:00+05:30,, How Yemenis are victims of a forgotten war | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/

3679,Rajeev Khanna,"The popularity of Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat seems slipping. So much so that people of the hilly state have started doubting whether he can complete his term. Several BJP leaders reportedly have been unhappy, but are yet to come out in the open as they fear the wrath of the party's National President   and Prime Minister  . Uttarakhand already has a dubious distinction of having nine chief ministerial changes in its short life of 18 years. Barring Narayan Datt Tewari, the first elected CM, none have been able to complete a five-year term. The unpopularity of Rawat can be gauged from the two episodes that made headlines in the state last week and were shared widely on the social media. The first was his ordering the detention and suspension of a school teacher at his 'Janta Darbar'. The teacher had sought a transfer to Dehradun after having served in a remote district for more than two decades. He was punished after a heated exchange with the CM with the latter showing absolute “insensitivity”. He has come in for massive criticism from across the cross section of society, particularly when it came to light that his own wife has been posted in Dehradun for the last 22 years and so has been the case of wives of other BJP ministers and members of Parliament who have been enjoying postings at places of their convenience. The second episode was again of a woman hurling abuses and threats at him when he went to the spot of a bus accident in Dhumakot where 48 people had died after an overloaded bus had tumbled in a gorge. So what makes Rawat unpopular? He was chosen to head the state government after a resounding victory of the   (BJP) in the Assembly polls in March 2017 due to his long association with the   (RSS) and his proximity to both Modi and Shah. The party won 57 of the 70 seats, decimating the Congress. But there are questions galore on his performance. There is a major resentment among the leaders in his own party, particularly the heavyweights who had left the Congress and had contested successfully on the BJP ticket in the Assembly polls. Sources say that these leaders have been ruing in private how their works are being stalled in the government. Another reason is his not appointing two ministers against existing vacancy. “The government has been in existence for one and a half years; yet these posts are vacant. The same is the case with ministerial level posts that are lying vacant in different bodies. “Only four such appointments have been made to these bodies and the latest appointment of Usha Negi to the constitutional position of chairperson of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has been controversial as she is said to be his distant relative,” pointed a political observer based in Dehradun. The elected leaders who are being denied their pound of flesh are seething in anger pointing that what face would they show to their supporters and with what enthusiasm would the latter work for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls if such a scenario continues for long. Among those who have reportedly complained is the former BJP state unit chief Bishan Singh Chauphal.  “You have people people who have won up to eight polls in their life not getting any ministerial berth or an equivalent post in any body in the state. Their anger is on expected lines,” said the observer. The agitated leaders do not buy the argument that giving posts to a few would offend the others in the party. They say that their cadres and they themselves worked hard to secure a poll victory and this needs to be rewarded to keep morale high.  According to a source, the BJP's victory in Gujarat and the recent Tharali bye-election gave some reprieve to Rawat and as of now he continues to enjoy the support of Modi and Shah despite opposition to him. “But much will depend on the performance of the party in the Lok Sabha polls if they decide to go into the battle without any change and he would have completed half his tenure by then,” the source added. For the last one week speculation have been rife about who can replace Rawat. Among the various names doing the rounds, senior cabinet minister Prakash Pant seems to be a frontrunner. Several people have also pointed out the disconnect between the CM and the masses. The local media now holds his media adviser, Ramesh Bhatt, for letting the CM down on several occasions. Journalists have complained about how Bhatt has been throwing his weight around. According to sources, Bhatt has been issuing 'orders' to journalists, especially those with the electronic media, to avoid reporting the duel between the teacher and Rawat unflatteringly. Many reporters alleged that he was more keen for his own publicity than for the CM.",2018-07-07 18:28:00+05:30,, Uttarakhand CM Trivendra Rawat's popularity on decline.

3682,Speed News Desk,"The only indigenous people in India are the Adivasis, who Nihar Ranjan Ray described as “the original autochthonous people of India.” The rest, be they Dravidian or Aryan, Hindu or Muslim, Rajput or Jat, are migrants with as much or as little claim as the European settlers in the new world have to be known as Americans. It is true that the colonizing people in the Americas have managed to forge a distinct new identity and the world acknowledges them as that but to believe them to be an indigenous people would be akin to the patently bogus Afrikaner claim to be an indigenous African people.Clearly both, the Aryans and Dravidians were migrant races that traveled eastwards in search of pastures for their cattle and fertile land for agriculture. This is where we run into ideological problems with the ultra-nationalist and conservative Hindu gerontocracy that are foisting a new genealogy upon our nation. The word out now is that we, Indians of today, are an indigenous people. Nothing can be further from the truth. There are scientific ways to discover who we are. The recent advances in genetics have made it possible to draw linkages between peoples of different regions. Studies in India have not only confirmed that Nihar Ranjan Ray was right when he said that the Adivasi of Central India was the only real native of this country. A study by Dr. Michael Bamshad MD, geneticist at the University of Utah published in the June 2001 of Genome Research, explicitly states that the ancestors of modern upper caste Indian populations are genetically more similar to Europeans and lower caste populations are more similar to Asians. Another study conducted by Andhra University scientists BB Rao, M Naidu, BVR Prasad and others, has found the southern Indian to be quite distinct to the northern Indian, in terms of genetic makeup at least. Despite the divergent trails of genetic markers, Aryans and Dravidians may not be that far removed from each other. Linguists have for long been agreed that “English, Dutch, German, and Russian are each branches of the vast Indo-European language family, which includes Germanic, Slavic, Celtic, Baltic, Indo-Iranian and other languages, -- all descendants of more ancient languages like Greek, Latin and Sanskrit. The linguists have reconstructed an earlier language from which the latter were derived. They call it Proto-Indo-European, or PIE for short.” Dr. Alexis Manaster Ramer of Wayne State University, USA digs even deeper and finds common roots between PIE and two other language groups: Uralic, which includes Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian; and Altaic that includes Turkish and Mongolian. All these three groups, Dr. Ramer argues, find their roots in an older language called Nostratic. If he is right then all Indian languages, Sanskritic or Dravidian are descended from Nostratic, spoken about 12000 years ago? Dr. Vitaly Shevoroshkin at the Institute of Linguistics at Moscow, and another Russian scholar, Dr. Aaron Dogopolsky now at the University of Haifa, did a pioneering work in establishing the Nostratic language in the 1960s, and this today is the inspiration to younger linguists like Ramer. Language, as linguists see it, is more just the heard word and the spoken for we can even communicate with gestures and signs. According to Dr. Derek Bickerton of the University of Hawaii, “the essence of language is words and syntax, each generated by a combinational system in the brain.” Dr. Asko Parpola, a prominent Finnish scholar raises a fundamental question as to whether Sanskrit is a Dravidian language and advances enough evidence to suggest that is just what it is. Scholars have written on the similarities of words and syntax between the Dravidian languages, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu, and the Finno-Ugrian languages. While the modern versions of these Dravidian languages are considerably influenced by Sanskrit words, the old writings “do not contain a single Sanskrit word.” On the other hand, some scholars argue, a number of Dravidian “loanwords” appear in the Rig Veda. Not only Sanskrit but languages like Latin and Greek too have a number of loanwords from Dravidian. For instance, the proto-Dravidian word for rice, arici is similar to oryza in Latin and Greek, and ginger is inciver in Tamil while it is ingwer in German, zinziberis in Greek. This lends much credence to the theory that the original Dravidians were of Mediterranean and Armenoid stock, who in the 4th millennium BC had settled in the Indus Valley. The continued presence of a Dravidian language, Brahui, in Pakistan’s Baluchistan province still spoken by more than half a million people, further suggests that the Dravidians moved eastwards and southwards under Aryan pressure. Whatever be its origins, it seems clear that the Sanskrit that emerged out of the Aryan Dravidian fusion was the language of a light skinned elite and was replaced by Persian, another Indo-European language of another light skinned elite. Santosh Kumar Khare on the origin of Hindi in “Truth about Language in India” (EPW, December 14, 2002) writes: “the notion of Hindi and Urdu as two distinct languages crystallized at Fort William College in the first half of the 19th century.” He adds: “their linguistic and literary repertoires were built up accordingly, Urdu borrowing from Persian/Arabic and Hindi from Sanskrit.” They came to represent the narrow competing interests of emergent middle class urban Hindu and Muslim/Kayastha groups. But the real sting is in the conclusion that “modern Hindi (or Khari boli) was an artificial construct of the East India Company which, while preserving the grammar and diction of Urdu, cleansed it of ‘foreign and rustic’ words and substituted them with Sanskrit synonyms.”   By - Mohan Guruswamy",2018-08-22 18:02:00+05:30,, WHO ARE WE? | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
3683,Sulagna Sengupta,"Journalist Chandan Mitra, who recently switched to Trinamool Congress from the   (BJP), said he felt the transition would help him work for the betterment of West Bengal. Mitra, who runs the Pioneer daily, has been a Rajya Sabha member from the saffron party. But of late he had reportedly fallen out of favour with the current party leadership. He, however, told Catch News: “I don’t have any grievance. The BJP put me in its national executive and also sent me to the Rajya Sabha twice. I held important positions in the party. Still, I feel that I need to do something for Bengal. That’s why after considerable thought I decided to quit the BJP.” Mitra said he felt Banerjee's party can give him the ideal platform to work for the development of West Bengal. Sources in the BJP said Mitra was unhappy with some of the party's policies and often protested. Citing the example of Kairana bye-poll, which the BJP lost arguably due to the woes of sugarcane farmers, the source said Mitra stressed the told need to ensure farmers' welfare but the party paid little heed. After being a nominated member to Parliament's Upper House from 2003 to 2009 , Mitra represented Madhya Pradesh there from 2010. In 2014, he unsuccessfully contested from the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat in Bengal. Calling it a mistake, Mitra said he failed to mix with the people of Hooghly. “I sought advice from   on whether or not to take the plunge. He told me to contest from Bengal,” he added. Referring to his current choice, Mitra said no political party could match the momentum of Trinamool in the past few years and Banerjee has already taken enough measures for the welfare of the state's farmers.",2018-07-25 10:24:00+05:30,, Trinamool offers me a chance to work for Bengal: Chandan Mitra | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
3684,Pinak Ranjan  Chakravarty,"Imran Khan took his oath of office as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan after 22 years of struggle as a politician. Khan won 176 seats in the Assembly vote, defeating Pakistan Muslin League (PML-N) candidate, Shahbaz Sharif (brother of jailed former PM Nawaz Sharif) who bagged 96 seats, after a raucous debate. While there was some talk of Opposition parties closing ranks, that did not happen. The Zardari-Bilawal Bhutto led Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) broke ranks and abstained. For discerning observers of the swearing-in ceremony, there were several significant takeaways. The first striking one was Imran’s current wife, a soothsayer, arriving resplendent in a cream dress and a full-face burkha, with a slit for her eyes only. The Wahaabi tradition of Pakistan’s benefactor and so-called godfather, Saudi Arabia, has now reached the PM’s household.  The second was the rather grim visage of the Pakistani President Mamnoon Hussain, who thought it fit not to smile, perhaps in deference to the ceremony. But why he chose to scowl is anyone’s guess. Perhaps Khan did not meet with his approval as PM. Hussain’s otherwise genial and smiling photos on the internet are a complete contrast. The third significant takeaway was Imran’s mispronouncing certain words in the oath of the text. The text of the oath was heavily infiltrated by Arabic words and loaded with Islamic phrases. The Oxford-educated Imran fumbled in pronouncing several Arabised words. This shows how far Pakistan has travelled in creating an identity which can be positioned as far away as possible from South Asia, particularly India. Pakistan has, as a matter of State policy, systematically eliminated Hindi words from its version of Urdu, its national language, as Islamisation of politics, society, education and other aspects of life has been enforced, ever since Gen Zia ul Huq began the Islamisation programme. The irony is worth noting. Urdu was born in India and was never spoken in Pakistan. Urdu retains its Hindi grammar, which Pakistan cannot expunge. A principal reason why Urdu has slipped into relative obscurity in India is because it was seen as a language of Muslims, which Islamic Pakistan adopted as its national language. The fourth important takeaway was former cricketer and current minister in the Congress government in Punjab,  ’s presence at the ceremony. His sitting next to the so-called president of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and his “jhappi” with a fellow Punjabi speaker, none other than Pak Army chief General Qamar Bajwa. Sidhu was conspicuously visible on TV screens, wearing a pink turban and chatting with other guests. His presence and hobnobbing with Bajwa was bound to raise hackles in India. The BJP has attacked him for his behaviour and demanded that the Congress get him to resign. An unfazed Sidhu went on to praise Imran and hoped that the new government will work for peace with India. The seat can't not be a random decision. A ceremonial occasion does not lend itself to such whimsical decisions on seating arrangements. The decision to seat Sidhu next to the so-called president of PoK was deliberate and designed to provoke India. If goodwill has to be generated then this was not the right move. Sidhu, meanwhile, has been mildly censured by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh. PM Khan’s 21-member Cabinet comprises many who have held positions in the regime of former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf. The new Foreign Minister (FM) will be Shah Mahmood Qureshi, a former FM in the PPP government when the Mumbai terrorist attack occurred in 2008.  Qureshi was visiting India when the Pakistani terrorists were attacking in Bombay. He had to return home to escape the inevitable embarrassment of having been undercut by his country’s Army, the chief coordinator of the Bombay terrorist outrage. Qureshi later quit the PPP and joined Imran Khan’s party. Shirin Mazari, an adviser to Khan has been appointed as Minister for Human Rights. She once advocated nuclear strikes against India’s population centres in one of her papers on Pakistan’s nuclear doctrine. She will have her task cut out dealing with Pakistan’s dismal human rights record, particularly in Balochistan, where the Army has been violating human rights with impunity and unfailing regularity, attempting for decades to cow down and eliminate freedom fighters. The Army will surely ring-fence any effort to make it accountable for human rights violations and it is unlikely that Mazari, a right-wing hard-liner will cross swords with the Army. Notwithstanding widespread allegations of a “fixed” election, it is still noteworthy that Pakistan has had its third election and democratic transfer of power. A significant factor in this election has been the participation of candidates backed by terrorist organisations who have been nurtured by the Army/ISI. This has often been called the “mainstreaming” of terrorists in an attempt to giving them legitimacy and deflecting international pressure. This effort has not succeeded since all such candidates lost.  The jihadi organisations have to realise that they have no future in Pakistan’s electoral politics. For the Army/ISI the collateral advantage is that they will remain subservient to their diktats. Nevertheless, the people of Pakistan have again shown that they may be religious and even ultra-religious but they will not hand over the reins of governance to jihadis and religious radicals. This is a silver lining in Pakistan’s polity. There is another important underlying change in the dynamics of Pakistan’s polity. The real power centre, the Army, today is reasonably confident of ensuring that its writ runs on what it regards as crucial aspects of State policy, without interference from civilian elected leaders. The earlier option of ejecting an elected government via military coups is now redundant.  Hence civilian leaders will be restricted to their own space in State policy as decided by the Army. Khan’s electoral slogan of building a “Naya” Pakistan and seeking peace with India will be tested on the hard realities of who controls Pakistan’s India policy. Whether Imran can build a new or “Naya” Pakistan, as per his electoral slogan, is an open question.  PM Modi has congratulated PM Khan on his electoral victory. India is likely to keep the door open for engagement. However, if PM Khan wants to normalise relations with India he will have to avoid approaching ties through the prism of Kashmir. Imran’s career as PM will follow the trajectory decided by the Army/ISI. He may get some leeway but on “core” external issues, the leash will be firmly held by his Army/ISI benefactors. Imran has complex challenges on the domestic front with multiple deep-rooted internal problems, including the parlous state of the Pakistan economy. There is no merit in pre-judging what he can achieve as PM. The most important challenge for Imran will be the sensitive civilian-military relations and the “Lakshman Rekha” drawn by the Army/ISI. If Imran chooses to cross it, then he will end up as another Nawaz Sharif.

3686,Catch Team,"Even as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of mass rape at a shelter home in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur goes on, another case of exploitation of female inmates at a shelter has surfaced. The institution, Alpawas Grih, is in Hajipur, 50-odd kilometres from Muzaffarpur. Several inmates of Alpawas alleged that a senior functionary at the shelter, Manmohan Prasad Singh, often visited their floor alone and touched them inappropriately. The inmates alleged Singh also forced them to massage his legs and hit them if they refused. At least one inmate also alleged he recently tried to tear her clothes off. Singh is serving the Women Development Corporation, under the social welfare department, as its Vaishali district programme manager. Shelter manager Karuna Kumari confirmed that Singh would order all staff members to go downstairs while he himself would visit the inmates either alone or with another official, Priyanka Kumari. The inmates had reportedly complained against Singh about a month ago, following which the district magistrate ordered for a probe. Convinced by the probe report, the DM ordered Singh's arrest.The state government and the governing   (United)-  coalition have drawn flak over the Muzaffarpur case because of government largesse towards prime accused Brajesh Thakur. The Hajipur case, however, has the potential to reverse that narrative and put the Opposition on the mat. Nidan, the non-government organisation that runs Alpawas, is headed by a man who also dons the cap of the head of one of the Congress party's national cells: Arbind Singh, executive director of Nidan, also chairs the All-India Unorganised Workers Congress. This special All-India Congress Committee (AICC) cell was launched by Congress President   last November and is believed to be one of the projects close to his heart. Singh is believed to be close to Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken. The JD(U) has already tried to create an uproar over Thakur's alleged links with Congress parliamentarian and former Union minister Akhilesh Singh. Alpawas and Nidan may become another source of embarrassment for the Grand Old Party. Bihar Congress chief Kaukab Qadri told Catch that since his party has been constantly raising its voice to hold the state government accountable for the Muzaffarpur case, it would not hesitate from acting if any Congress leader was found to be involved in any such case.  He added that though AICC officials were beyond his jurisdiction, he would discuss the issue with the party high command. Weeks ago, old photographs of Thakur with Akhilesh Singh had come out, giving JD(U) an opportunity to allege that Thakur had links with the Congress. Thakur himself had reportedly said he wanted to contest elections from Muzaffarpur on a Congress ticket. With Nidan and Arbind Singh in the picture now, the JD(U)-BJP combine may get yet another opportunity to turn the tables on the Congress.",2018-08-22 17:28:00+05:30,, Bihar’s latest shelter scandal at centre run by Cong leader’s NGO | Catch News,http://www.catchnews.com/
